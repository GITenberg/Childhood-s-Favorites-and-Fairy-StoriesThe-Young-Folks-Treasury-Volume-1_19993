<h2 style="margin-top: 2em;">GENERAL INTRODUCTION</h2>

<hr class="short" />


<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">B</span></p>
<p><b>OOKS</b> are as much a part of the furnishing of a house
as tables and chairs, and in the making of a home they
belong, not with the luxuries but with the necessities. A bookless
house is not a home; for a home affords food and shelter
for the mind as well as for the body. It is as great an offence
against a child to starve his mind as to starve his body, and
there is as much danger of reducing his vitality and putting
him at a disadvantage in his lifework in the one as in the other
form of deprivation. There was a time when it was felt that
shelter, clothing, food and physical oversight comprised the
whole duty of a charitable institution to dependent children;
to-day no community would permit such an institution to exist
unless it provided school privileges. An acute sense of responsibility
toward children is one of the prime characteristics
of American society, shown in the vast expenditures for public
education in all forms, in the increasing attention paid to light,
ventilation, and safety in school buildings, in the opening of
play grounds in large cities, in physical supervision of children
in schools, and the agitation against the employment of children
in factories, and in other and less obvious ways.</p>

<p>Children are helpless to protect themselves and secure what
they need for health of body and mind; they are exceedingly
impressionable; and the future is always in their hands. The
first and most imperative duty of parents is to give their children
the best attainable preparation for life, no matter at what
sacrifice to themselves. There are hosts of fathers and mothers
who recognize this obligation but do not know how to discharge
it; who are eager to give their children the most wholesome
conditions, but do not know how to secure them; who are
especially anxious that their children should start early and start
right on that highway of education which is the open road to
honorable success. There are many homes in which books
<span class="left"><a name="pageviii" id="pageviii"></a>[page&nbsp;viii]</span>
would find abundant room if the heads of the families knew
what books to buy, or had the means to put into the hands
of the growing child the reading matter it needs in the successive
periods of its growth.</p>

<p>This condition of eagerness to give the best, and of ignorance
of how or where to find the best is the justification for the
publication of this set of books. The attempt has been made
in a series of twelve volumes to bring together in convenient
form the fairy stories, myths, and legends which have fed the
children of many generations in the years when the imagination
is awakening and craving stimulus and material to work upon;&mdash;that
age of myth-making which is a prelude to the more scientific
uses of the mind and of immense importance in an intensely
practical age;&mdash;a group of tales of standard quality and an interest
and value which have placed them among the permanent
possessions of English literature; a careful selection of stories of
animal life; a natural history, familiar in style and thoroughly
trustworthy in fact; an account of those travels and adventures
which have opened up the earth and made its resources available,
and which constitute one of the most heroic chapters in the
history of the long struggle of men to possess the earth and make
it a home for the highest kind of civilization; a record of heroism
taken from the annals of the patriots and of those brave men
who, in all ages, ranks of society and occupations, have dared
to face great dangers in the path of duty and science, with
special attention to that everyday heroism in which the age is
specially rich and of which so many good people are grossly
ignorant; a survey of scientific achievement, with reports of
recent discoveries in knowledge and adaptation of knowledge
to human need; a group of biographies of the men and women&mdash;mostly
Americans&mdash;who are the most stimulating companions
for boys and girls; a volume on the Fine Arts dealing with music,
painting, sculpture, architecture, in a way to instruct young
readers and making accessible a large number of those songs
which appeal in the best way to children in schools and homes;
a collection of the best poetry for the youngest and oldest readers,
chosen not only for excellence from the standpoint of art, but
deep and abiding human interest; and a volume devoted to
<span class="left"><a name="pageix" id="pageix"></a>[page&nbsp;ix]</span>
the occupations and resources of the home, addressed to parents
no less than to children, with practical suggestions about books
and reading, games and amusements, exercise and health, and
those kindred topics which have to do with making the home
wholesome and attractive.</p>

<p>These twelve volumes aim, in brief, to make the home the
most inspiring school and the most attractive place for pleasure,
and to bring the best the world has to offer of adventure, heroism,
achievement and beauty within its four walls.</p>

<p>Special attention has been given to the youngest children
whose interests are often neglected because they are thought to
be too immature to receive serious impressions from what is
read to them. Psychology is beginning to make us understand
that no greater mistake can be made in the education of children
than underrating the importance of the years when the soil
receives the seed most quickly. For education of the deepest
sort&mdash;the planting of those formative ideas which give final
direction and quality to the intellectual life&mdash;there is no period
so important as the years between three and six, and none so
fruitful. To put in the seed at that time is, as a rule, to decide
the kind of harvest the child will reap later; whether he shall
be a shrewd, keen, clever, ambitious man, with a hard, mechanical
mind, bent on getting the best of the world; or a generous,
fruitful, open-minded man, intent on living the fullest life in
mind and heart. No apology is offered for giving large space
to myths, legends, fairy stories, tales of all sorts, and to poetry;
for in these expressions of the creative mind is to be found the
material on which the imagination has fed in every age and
which is, for the most part, conspicuously absent from our
educational programmes.</p>

<p>America has at present greater facility in producing "smart"
men than in producing able men; the alert, quick-witted, money-maker
abounds, but the men who live with ideas, who care for
the principles of things, and who make life rich in resource
and interest are comparatively few. America needs poetry more
than it needs industrial training; though the two ought never
to be separated. The time to awaken the imagination, which
is the creative faculty, is early childhood; and the most accessible
<span class="left"><a name="pagex" id="pagex"></a>[page&nbsp;x]</span>
material for this education is the literature which the race
created in its childhood. The creative man, whether in the
arts or in practical affairs, in poetry, in engineering or in business,
is always the man of imagination.</p>

<p>In this library for young people the attempt has been made
not only to give the child what it needs but in the form which
is most easily understood. For this reason some well-known
stories have been retold in simpler English than their classic
forms present. This is especially true of many tales for any
young children reprinted by special arrangement from recent
English sources. In some cases, where the substance has seemed
of more importance to the child than the form, simpler words
and forms of expression have been substituted for more complex
or abstract phrases, and passages of minor importance have
been condensed or omitted.</p>

<p>The aim in making the selections in this set of books has
been to interest the child and give it what it needs for normal
growth; the material has been taken from many sources old and
new; much of the reading matter presented has been familiar
in one form or another, to generations of children; much has
appeared for the first time within the last ten years; a considerable
part has been prepared especially for the Treasury and
a large part has been selected from the best writing in the
various fields.</p>

<p>It is the hope of the Editor that this "Treasury" or
"Library" will justify its title by its real and fundamental service
to children and parents alike.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;">INTRODUCTION</h2>



<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">S</span></p>
<p><b>INCE</b> this series of books is intended for all young people
from one to one hundred, it opens with about eighty of
the old <span class="sc">Mother Goose Rhymes</span>. Nothing better was ever
invented to tell to little folks who are young enough for lullabies.
Their rhythm, their humor, and their pith will always
cause us to prize them as the Babies' Classics.</p>

<p>Next come a score of the most famous <span class="sc">Nursery Tales</span>,
the kind that children cry for and love to hear fifty times over.
And since, just as soon as little folks like stories they love to
hear them in rhyme, here are forty <span class="sc">Children's Favorite
Poems</span>.</p>

<p>What would young life be without "Puss in Boots" and
"Little Red Riding Hood" and "The Sleeping Beauty"? Our
<span class="sc">Treasury</span> would indeed be poor without them, so these
<span class="sc">Favorite Stories</span> come next, yoked with some <span class="sc">Old-Fashioned
Poems</span> in story-form, as "The Night before Christmas,"
"The Wonderful World," and "Little Orphant Annie." All
who love pets and animals have always liked <span class="sc">Fables</span>, so here
are the noted parables of &AElig;sop, and the lesser-known but
even more jolly tales from East Indian sources.</p>

<p>The fairy-tale age is supposed to come from four to nine,
but the editors are sure it lasts much longer than that. However
this may be, the better half of our first volume is given
up to <span class="sc">Fairy Tales and Laughter Stories</span> from all over the
world.</p>

<p>It ends with <span class="sc">Tales for Tiny Tots</span>, the kind that mother
reads beside the fire at bedtime, some of them old, like the
"Little Red Hen" and "Peter Rabbit," and some of them
newer, like "The Greedy Brownie" and "The Birthday Honors
of the Fairy Queen."</p>

<h1>NURSERY TALES</h1>

<hr class="short" />

<h2>THE THREE BEARS</h2>

<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">L</span></p>
<p><b>ITTLE</b> Goldilocks was a pretty girl who lived once upon
a time in a far-off country.</p>

<p>One day she was sitting on the hearthrug playing with
her two kittens, and you would have thought she was as happy
as a queen, and quite contented to stay where she was instead
of wanting to run about the world meddling with other people's
property. But it happened that she was rather a mischievous
little maid, and could not resist teasing her pets, so one of them
scratched her, and then she would play with them no longer.</p>

<p>She got up and trotted away into the wood behind her
mother's house, and it was such a warm, pleasant day that she
wandered on and on until she came into a part of the wood
where she had never been before.</p>

<p>Now, in this wood there lived a family of three Bears.
The first was a <span style="font-size: 1.4em;"><b>GREAT BIG BEAR</b></span>, the second was a
<b>MIDDLING-SIZED BEAR</b>, and the third was a <span class="sc"><b>little teeny
tiny bear</b></span>, and they all lived together in a funny little house, and
very happy they were.</p>

<p>Goldilocks stopped when she came to the Bears' house,
and began to wonder who lived there.</p>

<p>"I'll just look in and see," she said, and so she did; but
there was no one there, for the Bears had all gone out for a
morning walk, whilst the soup they were going to have for
dinner cooled upon the table.</p>

<p>Goldilocks was rather hungry after her walk, and the soup
smelt so good that she began to wish the people of the house
would come home and invite her to have some. But although
she looked everywhere, under the table and into the cupboards,
she could find no one, and at last she could resist no longer,
<span class="left"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[page&nbsp;33]</span>
but made up her mind to take just a little sip to see how the soup
tasted. The soup had been put into three bowls&mdash;a Great
Big Bowl for the Great Big Bear, a Middling-sized Bowl for
the Middling-sized Bear, and a Teeny Tiny Bowl for the
Teeny Tiny Bear; beside each bowl lay a spoon, and Goldilocks
took one and helped herself to a spoonful of soup from the Great
Big Bowl.</p>

<p>Ugh! how it burnt her mouth; it was so hot with pepper
that she did not like it at all; still, she was very hungry, so she
thought she would try again.</p>

<p>This time she took a sip of the Middling-sized Bear's soup,
but she liked that no better, for it was too salt. But when she
tasted the Teeny Tiny Bear's soup it was just as she liked it;
so she ate it up every drop, without thinking twice about it.</p>

<p>When she had finished her dinner she noticed three chairs
standing by the wall. One was a Great Big Chair, and
she climbed upon that and sat down. Oh, dear! how hard it
was! She was sure she could not sit there for long, so she
climbed up on the next, which was only a Middling-sized
Chair, but that was too soft for her taste; so she went on to the
last, which was a Teeny Tiny Chair and suited her exactly.</p>

<p>It was so comfortable that she sat on and on until, if you'll
believe it, she actually sat the bottom out. Then, of course,
she was comfortable no longer, so she got up and began to
wonder what she should do next.</p>

<p>There was a staircase in the Bears' house, and Goldilocks
thought she would go up it and see where it led to. So up she
went, and when she reached the top she laughed outright, for
the Bears' bedroom was the funniest she had ever seen. In
the middle of the room stood a Great Big Bed, on one side of
it there was a Middling-sized Bed, and on the other side there
was a Teeny Tiny Bed.</p>

<p>Goldilocks was sleepy, so she thought she would lie down
and have a little nap. First she got upon the Great Big Bed,
but it was just as hard as the Great Big Chair had been; so
she jumped off and tried the Middling-sized Bed, but it was so
soft that she sank right down into the feather cushions and was
nearly smothered.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[page&nbsp;34]</span>
<p>
"I will try the Teeny Tiny Bed," she said, and so she did,
and it was so comfortable that she soon fell fast asleep.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="center"><b>Who Has Been Tasting My Soup?</b></p>
</div>

<p>Whilst she lay there, dreaming of all sorts of pleasant things,
the three Bears came home from their walk very hungry and
quite ready for their dinners.</p>

<p>But, oh! dear me! how cross the Great Big Bear looked
when he saw his spoon had been used and thrown under the
table.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.4em;">"<b>WHO HAS BEEN TASTING MY SOUP?</b>"</span>
he cried, in a Great Big Voice.</p>

<p><b>"AND WHO HAS BEEN TASTING MINE?"</b> cried the
Middling-sized Bear, in a Middling-sized Voice.</p>

<p><span class="sc"><b>"but who has been tasting mine and tasted it all up?"</b></span>
cried the poor little Teeny Tiny Bear in a Teeny Tiny Voice,
with the tears running down his Teeny Tiny Face.</p>

<p>When the Great Big Bear went to sit down in his Great
Big Chair, he cried out in his Great Big Voice:</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.4em;"><b>"WHO HAS BEEN SITTING ON MY CHAIR?"</b></span></p>

<p>And the Middling-sized Bear cried, in a Middling-sized
Voice:</p>

<p><b>"WHO HAS BEEN SITTING ON MY CHAIR?"</b></p>

<p>But the Teeny Tiny Bear cried out in a Teeny Tiny Voice
of anger:</p>

<p><span class="sc"><b>"who has been sitting on my chair, and sat the bottom out?"</b></span></p>

<p>By this time the Bears were sure that someone had been
in their house quite lately; so they looked about to see if someone
were not there still.</p>

<p>There was certainly no one downstairs, so they went up the
staircase to their bedroom.</p>

<p>As soon as the Great Big Bear looked at his bed, he cried
out, in his Great Big Voice:</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.4em;"><b>"WHO HAS BEEN LYING ON MY BED?"</b></span></p>

<p>And the Middling-sized Bear, seeing that the coverlet was
all rumpled, cried out, in a Middling-sized Voice:</p>

<p><b>"WHO HAS BEEN LYING ON MY BED?"</b></p>
<span class="left"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[page&nbsp;35]</span>
<p>
But the Teeny Tiny Bear cried out, in a Teeny Tiny Voice of
astonishment:</p>

<p><span class="sc"><b>"who has been lying on my bed and lies there still?"</b></span></p>

<p>Now, when the Great Big Bear began to speak, Goldilocks
dreamt that there was a bee buzzing in the room, and when
the Middling-sized Bear began to speak, she dreamt that it
was flying out of the window; but when the Teeny Tiny Bear
began to speak, she dreamt that the bee had come back and
stung her on the ear, and up she jumped. Oh! how frightened
she was when she saw the three Bears standing beside her.</p>

<p>She hopped out of bed and in a second was out through the
open window. Never stopping to wonder if the fall had hurt
her, she got up and ran and ran and ran until she could go no
farther, always thinking that the Bears were close behind her.
And when at length she fell down in a heap on the ground, because
she was too tired to run any more, it was her own mother
who picked her up, because in her fright she had run straight
home without knowing it.</p>

<h2>CINDERELLA</h2>

<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> upon a time there lived a noble gentleman who had
one dear little daughter. Poor child! her own kind mother
was dead, and her father, who loved her very dearly, was afraid
that his little girl was sometimes lonely. So he married a grand
lady who had two daughters of her own, and who, he thought,
would be kind and good to his little one. But no sooner did
the stepmother enter her new home than she began to show her
true character. Her stepdaughter was so much prettier and
sweeter than her own children, that she was jealous of her,
and gave her all the hard work of the house to do, whilst the
two proud sisters spent their time at pleasant parties and
entertainments.</p>

<p>The only pleasure the poor child had was to spend her evenings
sitting in the chimney-corner, resting her weary limbs,
and for this reason her sisters mockingly nicknamed her "Cinderella."
<span class="left"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[page&nbsp;36]</span>
The sisters' fine clothes made Cinderella feel very
shabby; but, in her little torn frock and ragged shoes, she was
a thousand times more lovely than they.</p>

<p>Now, it chanced that the King's son gave a grand ball,
to which he invited all the lords and ladies in the country, and,
amongst the rest, Cinderella's two sisters were asked. How
pleased and excited they were when the invitation arrived!
For days they could talk of nothing but the clothes they should
wear and the grand folk they hoped to meet.</p>

<p>When at last the great day arrived, Cinderella was kept
running about from early till late, decking the sisters, and
dressing their hair.</p>

<p>"Don't you wish you were going to the ball?" said one of
them.</p>

<p>"Indeed I do," sighed the poor little maid. The sisters
burst out laughing. "A pretty spectacle <i>you</i> would be," they
said rudely. "Go back to your cinders&mdash;they are fit company
for rags." Then, stepping carefully into their carriage so that
they might not crush their fine clothes, they drove away to the
ball.</p>

<p>Cinderella went back to her chimney-corner, and tried not
to feel envious, but the tears <i>would</i> gather in the pretty eyes,
and trickle down the sorrowful little face.</p>

<p>"What are you crying for, child?" cried a silvery voice.</p>

<p>Cinderella started, and raised her eyes. Who could it be?
Then in a moment she knew&mdash;it was her fairy Godmother!</p>

<a name="page37a" id="page37a"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/0560.jpg"><img src="images/0560-327.jpg" width="327" height="450" alt="It Was Her Fairy Godmother!" border="0" /></a><br /><br />
<p class="center"><b>It Was Her Fairy Godmother!</b></p>
</div>

<p>"I do so want&mdash;&mdash;" began Cinderella; then her sobs stopped
her.</p>

<p>"To go to the ball," finished the Godmother. Cinderella
nodded. "Well, leave off crying&mdash;be a good girl, and you
shall go. Run quickly into the garden, and bring the largest
pumpkin you can find."</p>

<p>Cinderella could not imagine how a pumpkin could help
her to go to the ball, but her only thought was to obey her
Godmother. In a few moments she was back again, with a
splendid pumpkin. Her Godmother scooped out the inside&mdash;one
touch of the wand, and the pumpkin was a golden coach,
lined with white satin.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[page&nbsp;37]</span>
<p>
"Now, godchild, quick&mdash;the mouse-trap from the pantry!"</p>

<p>"Here it is, Godmother," said Cinderella breathlessly.</p>

<p>One by one six fat sleek mice passed through the trap door.
As each appeared, a touch of the wand transformed it into a
cream-colored horse, fit for a queen.</p>

<p>"Now, Cinderella, can you find a coachman?"</p>

<p>"There is a large gray rat in the rat-trap&mdash;would he do,
Godmother?"</p>

<p>"Run and fetch him, child, and then I can judge," So
Cinderella ran to fetch the rat, and her Godmother said he was
just made for a coachman; and I think you would have agreed
with her had you seen him a moment later, with his powdered
wig and silk stockings.</p>

<p>Six lizards from behind the pumpkin-frame became six
footmen in splendid liveries&mdash;you would have thought they
had been footmen all their lives. Cinderella was so excited
that she could scarcely speak.</p>

<p>"Oh! Godmother," she cried, "it is all so lovely!" Then
suddenly she thought of her shabby frock. "There is my white
muslin," she said wistfully, "if&mdash;do you think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But before Cinderella could realize what was happening,
her Godmother's wand tapped her lightly on the shoulder,
and in place of the shabby frock, there was a gleam of satin,
silver, and pearls.</p>

<p>Ah! who can describe a robe made by the fairies? It was
white as snow, and as dazzling; round the hem hung a fringe
of diamonds, sparkling like dew-drops in the sunshine. The
lace about the throat and arms could only have been spun by
fairy spiders. Surely it was a dream! Cinderella put her
daintily-gloved hand to her throat, and softly touched the pearls
that encircled her neck.</p>

<p>"Come, child," said the Godmother, "or you will be late."</p>

<p>As Cinderella moved, the firelight shone upon her dainty
shoes.</p>

<p>"They are of diamonds," she said.</p>

<p>"No," answered her Godmother, smiling; "they are better
than that&mdash;they are of glass, made by the fairies. And now,
child, go, and enjoy yourself to your heart's content. Only
<span class="left"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[page&nbsp;38]</span>
remember, if you stay at the palace one instant after midnight,
your coach and servants will vanish, and you will be the
little gray Cinderella once more!"</p>

<p>A few moments later, the coach dashed into the royal
courtyard, the door was flung open, and Cinderella alighted.
As she walked slowly up the richly-carpeted staircase, there was
a murmur of admiration, and the King's son hastened to meet
her. "Never," said he to himself, "have I seen anyone so
lovely!" He led her into the ball-room, where the King, who
was much taken with her sweet face and pretty, modest manners,
whispered to the Queen that she must surely be a foreign
Princess.</p>

<p>The evening passed away in a dream of delight, Cinderella
dancing with no one but the handsome young Prince, and
being waited on by his own hands at supper-time. The two
sisters could not recognize their ragged little sister in the beautiful
and graceful lady to whom the Prince paid so much attention,
and felt quite pleased and flattered when she addressed a
few words to them.</p>

<p>Presently a clock chimed the three quarters past eleven,
and, remembering her Godmother's warning, Cinderella at
once took leave of the Prince, and, jumping into her coach, was
driven rapidly home. Here she found her Godmother waiting
to hear all about the ball. "It was <i>lovely</i>," said Cinderella;
"and oh! Godmother, there is to be another to-morrow night,
and I <i>should</i> so much like to go to it!"</p>

<p>"Then you shall," replied the kind fairy, and, kissing her
godchild tenderly, she vanished. When the sisters returned
from the ball, they found a sleepy little maiden sitting in the
chimney-corner, waiting for them.</p>

<p>"How late you are!" cried Cinderella, yawning. "Are
you not very tired?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," they answered, and then they told her
what a delightful ball it had been, and how the loveliest Princess
in the world had been there, and had spoken to them, and
admired their pretty dresses.</p>

<p>"Who was she?" asked Cinderella slyly.</p>

<p>"That we cannot say," answered the sisters. "She would
<span class="left"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[page&nbsp;39]</span>
not tell her name, though the Prince begged her to do so on
bended knee."</p>

<p>"Dear sister," said Cinderella, "I, too, should like to see
the beautiful Princess. Will you not lend me your old yellow
gown, that I may go to the ball to-morrow with you?"</p>

<p>"What!" cried her sister angrily; "lend one of my dresses
to a little cinder-maid? Don't talk nonsense, child!"</p>

<p>The next night, the sisters were more particular than ever
about their attire, but at last they were dressed, and as soon
as their carriage had driven away, the Godmother appeared.
Once more she touched her godchild with her wand, and in a
moment she was arrayed in a beautiful dress that seemed as
though it had been woven of moon-beams and sunshine, so
radiantly did it gleam and shimmer. She put her arms round
her Godmother's neck and kissed and thanked her. "Goodbye,
childie; enjoy yourself, but whatever you do, remember
to leave the ball before the clock strikes twelve," the Godmother
said, and Cinderella promised.</p>

<p>But the hours flew by so happily and so swiftly that Cinderella
forgot her promise, until she happened to look at a
clock and saw that it was on the stroke of twelve. With a
cry of alarm she fled from the room, dropping, in her haste, one
of the little glass slippers; but, with the sound of the clock
strokes in her ears, she dared not wait to pick it up. The
Prince hurried after her in alarm, but when he reached the
entrance hall, the beautiful Princess had vanished, and there
was no one to be seen but a forlorn little beggar-maid creeping
away into the darkness.</p>

<p>Poor little Cinderella!&mdash;she hurried home through the dark
streets, weary, and overwhelmed with shame.</p>

<p>The fire was out when she reached her home, and there was
no Godmother waiting to receive her; but she sat down in the
chimney-corner to wait her sisters' return. When they came
in they could speak of nothing but the wonderful things that
had happened at the ball.</p>

<p>The beautiful Princess had been there again, they said, but
had disappeared just as the clock struck twelve, and though the
Prince had searched everywhere for her, he had been unable
<span class="left"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[page&nbsp;40]</span>
to find her. "He was quite beside himself with grief," said
the elder sister, "for there is no doubt he hoped to make her
his bride."</p>

<p>Cinderella listened in silence to all they had to say, and,
slipping her hand into her pocket, felt that the one remaining
glass slipper was safe, for it was the only thing of all her grand
apparel that remained to her.</p>

<p>On the following morning there was a great noise of trumpets
and drums, and a procession passed through the town,
at the head of which rode the King's son. Behind him came
a herald, bearing a velvet cushion, upon which rested a little
glass slipper. The herald blew a blast upon the trumpet, and
then read a proclamation saying that the King's son would wed
any lady in the land who could fit the slipper upon her foot,
if she could produce another to match it.</p>

<p>Of course, the sisters tried to squeeze their feet into the slipper,
but it was of no use&mdash;they were much too large. Then Cinderella
shyly begged that she might try. How the sisters laughed
with scorn when the Prince knelt to fit the slipper on the
cinder-maid's foot; but what was their surprise when it slipped on
with the greatest ease, and the next moment Cinderella produced
the other from her pocket. Once more she stood in the slippers,
and once more the sisters saw before them the lovely Princess
who was to be the Prince's bride. For at the touch of the magic
shoes, the little gray frock disappeared for ever, and in place
of it she wore the beautiful robe the fairy Godmother had
given to her.</p>

<p>The sisters hung their heads with sorrow and vexation;
but kind little Cinderella put her arms round their necks,
kissed them, and forgave them for all their unkindness, so that
they could not help but love her.</p>

<p>The Prince could not bear to part from his little love again,
so he carried her back to the palace in his grand coach, and
they were married that very day. Cinderella's stepsisters were
present at the feast, but in the place of honor sat the fairy
Godmother.</p>

<p>So the poor little cinder-maid married the Prince, and in time
they came to be King and Queen, and lived happily ever after.</p>

<h2>THE THREE BROTHERS</h2>

<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HERE</b> was once a man who had three sons, but no fortune
except the house he lived in. Now, each of them wanted to
have the house after his death; but their father was just as
fond of one as of the other, and did not know how to treat them
all fairly. He did not want to sell the house, because it had
belonged to his forefathers, or he might have divided the money
between them.</p>

<p>At last an idea came into his head, and he said to his sons:
"Go out into the world, and each learn a trade, and when you
come home, the one who makes best use of his handicraft shall
have the house."</p>

<p>The sons were quite content with this plan, and the eldest
decided to be a farrier, the second a barber, and the third a
fencing master. They fixed a time when they would all meet
at home again, and then they set off.</p>

<p>It so happened that they each found a clever master with
whom they learned their business thoroughly. The farrier
shod the King's horses, and he thought, "I shall certainly be
the one to have the house."</p>

<p>The barber shaved nobody but grand gentlemen, so he
thought it would fall to him.</p>

<p>The fencing master got many blows, but he set his teeth,
and would not let himself be put out, because he thought, "If I
am afraid of a blow, I shall never get the house."</p>

<p>Now, when the given time had passed, they all went home
together to their father; but they did not know how to get a
good opportunity of showing off their powers, and sat down
to discuss the matter.</p>

<p>Suddenly a hare came running over the field.</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried the barber, "she comes just in the nick of time."</p>

<p>He took up his bowl and his soap, and got his lather by the
time the hare came quite close, then he soaped her and shaved
her as she raced along, without giving her a cut or missing a
single hair. His father, astonished, said: "If the others don't
look out, the house will be yours."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[page&nbsp;42]</span>
<p>
Before long a gentleman came along in his carriage at full
gallop.</p>

<p>"Now, father, you shall see what I can do," said the farrier
and he ran after the carriage and tore the four shoes off the
horse as he galloped along, then, without stopping a second,
shod him with new ones.</p>

<p>"You are a fine fellow, indeed," said his father. "You
know your business as well as your brother. I don't know
which I shall give the house to at this rate."</p>

<p>Then the third one said: "Let me have a chance, too,
father."</p>

<p>As it was beginning to rain, he drew his sword and swirled
it round and round his head, so that not a drop fell on him.
Even when the rain grew heavier, so heavy that it seemed as
if it were being poured from the sky out of buckets, he swung
the sword faster and faster, and remained as dry as if he had
been under a roof.</p>

<p>His father was amazed, and said: "You have done the
best; the house is yours."</p>

<p>Both the other brothers were quite satisfied with this decision,
and as they were all so devoted to one another, they
lived together in the house, and carried on their trades, by which
they made plenty of money, since they were so perfect in them.</p>

<p>They lived happily together to a good old age, and when
one fell ill and died, the others grieved so much over him that
they pined away and soon after departed this life.</p>

<p>Then, as they had been so fond of one another, they were
all buried in one grave.</p>

<h2>THE WREN AND THE BEAR</h2>

<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NE</b> summer's day the bear and the wolf were walking in
the forest, and the bear heard a bird singing very sweetly,
and said: "Brother Wolf, what kind of bird is that which is
singing so delightfully?"</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[page&nbsp;43]</span>
<p>
"That is the King of the birds, before whom we must do
reverence," replied the wolf; but it was only the wren.</p>

<p>"If that be so," said the bear, "I should like to see his royal
palace; come, lead me to it." "That cannot be as you like,"
replied the wolf. "You must wait till the Queen returns."
Soon afterward the Queen arrived with some food in her bill,
and the King, too, to feed their young ones, and the bear would
have gone off to see them, but the wolf, pulling his ear, said: "No,
you must wait till the Queen and the King are both off again."</p>

<p>So, after observing well the situation of the nest, the two
tramped off, but the bear had no rest, for he wished still to see
the royal palace, and after a short delay he set off to it again.
He found the King and Queen absent, and, peeping into the nest,
he saw five or six young birds lying in it. "Is this the royal
palace?" exclaimed the bear; "this miserable place! You are
no King's children, but wretched young vagabonds." "No, no,
that we are not!" burst out the little wrens together in a great
passion, for to them this speech was addressed. "No, no, we
are born of honorable parents, and you, Mr. Bear, shall make
your words good!" At this speech the bear and the wolf were
much frightened, and ran back to their holes; but the little
wrens kept up an unceasing, clamor till their parents' return.
As soon as they came back with food in their mouths the little
birds began, "We will none of us touch a fly's leg, but will
starve rather, until you decide whether we are fine and handsome
children or not, for the bear has been here and insulted us!"</p>

<p>"Be quiet," replied the King, "and that shall soon be
settled." And thereupon he flew with his Queen to the residence
of the bear, and called to him from the entrance, "Old grumbler,
why have you insulted my children? That shall cost you dear,
for we will decide the matter by a pitched battle."</p>

<p>War having thus been declared against the bear, all the four-footed
beasts were summoned: the ox, the ass, the cow, the goat,
the stag, and every animal on the face of the earth. The wren,
on the other hand, summoned every flying thing; not only the
birds, great and small, but also the gnat, the hornet, the bee,
and the flies.</p>

<p>When the time arrived for the commencement of the war,
<span class="left"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[page&nbsp;44]</span>
the wren King sent out spies to see who was appointed
commander-in-chief
of the enemy. The gnat was the most cunning of all
the army, and he, therefore, buzzed away into the forest where
the enemy was encamped, and alighted on a leaf of the tree
beneath which the watchword was given out. There stood
the bear and called the fox to him, and said: "You are the
most crafty of animals, so you must be general, and lead us on."
"Well," said the fox, "but what sign shall we appoint?" Nobody
answered. Then the fox said: "I have a fine long
bushy tail, which looks like a red feather at a distance; if I
hold this tail straight up, all is going well and you must march
after me; but if I suffer it to hang down, run away as fast as
you can." As soon as the gnat heard all this she flew home
and told the wren King everything to a hair.</p>

<p>When the day arrived for the battle to begin, the four-footed
beasts all came running along to the field, shaking the earth
with their roaring and bellowing. The wren King also came
with his army, whirring and buzzing and humming enough to
terrify any one out of his senses. Then the wren King sent the
hornet forward to settle upon the fox's tail and sting it with
all his power. As soon as the fox felt the first sting he drew
up his hind leg with the pain, still carrying, however, his tail as
high in the air as before; at the second sting he was obliged to
drop it a little bit; but at the third he could no longer bear the
pain, but was forced to drop his tail between his legs. As soon
as the other beasts saw this, they thought all was lost, and began
to run each one to his own hole; so the birds won the battle
without difficulty.</p>

<p>When all was over the wren King and his Queen flew home
to their children, and cried out: "Rejoice! rejoice! we have
won the battle; now eat and drink as much as you please."</p>

<p>The young wrens, however, said: "Still we will not eat
till the bear has come to our nest and begged pardon, and admitted
that we are fine and handsome children."</p>

<p>So the wren King flew back to the cave of the bear, and
called out, "Old grumbler, you must come to the nest and beg
pardon of my children for calling them wretched young brats,
else your ribs shall be crushed in your body!"</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[page&nbsp;45]</span>
<p>
In great terror the bear crept out and begged pardon; and
afterward the young wrens, being now made happy in their
minds, settled down to eating and drinking, and I am afraid
they were over-excited and kept up their merriment far too
late.</p>

<h2>CHICKEN-LICKEN</h2>

<p><b>S</b> Chicken-licken was going one day to the wood, whack!
an acorn fell from a tree on to his head.</p>

must have fallen; I must go and tell the King."</p>

<p>So Chicken-licken turned back, and met Hen-len.</p>

young ones soon ate up poor Chicken-licken, Hen-len, Cock-lock,
Duck-luck, Drake-lake, Goose-loose, Gander-lander,
and Turkey-lurkey; and they never saw the King to tell him
that the sky had fallen.</p>

<h2>THE FOX AND THE CAT</h2>

<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">I</span></p>
<p><b>T</b> happened once that the cat met Mr. Fox in the wood,
and because she thought he was clever and experienced in all
the ways of the world, she addressed him in a friendly manner.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, dear Mr. Fox! how are you, and how do
you get along in these hard times?"</p>

<p>The fox, full of pride, looked at the cat from head to foot
for some time, hardly knowing whether he would deign to
answer or not. At last he said:</p>

<p>"Oh, you poor whisker-wiper, you silly piebald, you starveling
mouse-hunter! what has come into your head? How dare
you ask me how I am getting on? What sort of education
have you had? How many arts are you master of?"</p>

<p>"Only one," said the cat meekly.</p>

<p>"And what might that one be?" asked the fox.</p>

<p>"When the dogs run after me, I can jump into a tree and
save myself."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" said the fox. "I am master of a hundred
arts, and I have a sackful of cunning tricks in addition. But
I pity you. Come with me, and I will teach you how to escape
from the dogs."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[page&nbsp;48]</span>
<p>
Just then a huntsman came along with four hounds. The
cat sprang trembling into a tree, and crept stealthily up to the
topmost branch, where she was entirely hidden by twigs and
leaves.</p>

<p>"Open your sack, Mr. Fox! open your sack!" cried the cat,
but the dogs had gripped him, and held him fast.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Fox!" cried the cat, "you with your hundred
arts, and your sackful of tricks, are held fast, while I, with my
one, am safe. Had you been able to creep up here, you would
not have lost you life."</p>

<h2>THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW</h2>

<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HERE</b> once lived in Japan a rat and his wife, folk of noble
race, who had one beautiful daughter. They were exceedingly
proud of her charms, and dreamed, as parents will, of the
grand marriage she was sure to make in time. Proud of his pure
rodent blood, the father saw no son-in-law more to be desired
than a young rat of ancient lineage, whose attentions to his
daughter were very marked. This match, however, brilliant
as it was, seemed not to the mother's taste. Like many people
who think themselves made out of special clay, she had a very
poor opinion of her own kind, and was ambitious for an alliance
with the highest circles. To the stars! was her motto, she
always said, and really, when one has a daughter of incomparable
beauty, one may well hope for an equally incomparable son-in-law.</p>

<p>"Address yourself to the sun at once, then," cried the impatient
father one day; "there is nothing above him, surely."</p>

<p>"Quite so; I had already thought of it," she answered,
"and since you, too, are in sympathy with the idea, we will
make our call to-morrow."</p>

<p>So, on the following morning the proud father and the
<span class="left"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[page&nbsp;49]</span>
haughty mother-rat went together to present their lovely
daughter to the orb of day.</p>

<p>"Lord Sun," said the mother, "let me present our only
daughter, who is so beautiful that there is nothing like her
in the whole world. Naturally we desire a son-in-law as
wonderful as she, and, as you see, we have come to you first
of all."</p>

<p>"Really," said the sun, "I am extremely flattered by your
proposal, but you do me too much honor; there is some one
greater than I; it is the cloud. Look, if you do not believe." ... And
at that moment the cloud arrived, and with one
waft of his folds extinguished the sun with all his golden rays.</p>

<p>"Very well; let us speak to the cloud, then," said the mother-rat,
not in the least disconcerted.</p>

<p>"Immensely honored, I am sure," replied the cloud in his
turn, "but you are again mistaken; there is some one greater
than I; it is the wind. You shall see."</p>

<p>At the same moment along came the wind, and with one
blow swept the cloud out of sight, after which, overturning
father, mother, and daughter, he tumbled with them, pell-mell,
at the foot of an old wall.</p>

<p>"Quick, quick," cried the mother-rat, struggling to her
feet, "and let us repeat our compliments to the wind."</p>

<p>"You'd better address yourself to the wall," growled the
wind roughly. "You see very well he is greater than I, for he
stops me and makes me draw back."</p>

<p>No sooner had she heard these words than mother-rat
faced about and presented her daughter to the wall. Ah, but
now the fair rat-maiden imitated the wind; she drew back also.
He whom she really adored in her heart of hearts was the fascinating
young rat who had paid his court to her so well. However,
to please her mother, she had consented to wed the Sun,
in spite of his blinding rays, or the cloud, in spite of his sulky
look, even the wind, in spite of his brusque manner; but an old,
broken wall! ... No! death would be better a thousand times.</p>

<p>Fortunately the wall excused himself, like all the rest.
"Certainly," he said, "I can stop the wind, who can sweep
away the cloud, who can cover up the Sun, but there is some
<span class="left"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[page&nbsp;50]</span>
one greater than I: it is the rat, who can pass through my body,
and can even, if he chooses, reduce me to powder with his
teeth. Believe me, you need seek no better son-in-law; greater
than the rat, there is nothing in the world."</p>

<p>"Do you hear that, wife, do you hear it?" cried father-rat
in triumph. "Didn't I always say so?"</p>

<p>"Quite true! you always did," returned the mother-rat in
wonder, and suddenly glowed with pride in her ancient name
and lineage.</p>

<p>So they all three went home, very happy and contented, and
on the morrow the lovely rat-maiden married her faithful rat-lover.</p>

<h2>THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE</h2>

<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b>
 upon a time a little mouse and a little sausage, who
loved each other like sisters, decided to live together, and
made their arrangements in such a way that every day one
would go to walk in the fields, or make purchases in town,
while the other remained at home to keep the house.</p>

<p>One day, when the little sausage had prepared cabbage for
dinner, the little mouse, who had come back from town with a
fine appetite, enjoyed it so greatly that she exclaimed: "How
delicious the cabbage is to-day, my dear!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" answered the little sausage, "that is because I
popped myself into the pot while it was cooking."</p>

<p>On the next day, as it was her turn to prepare the meals,
the little mouse said to herself: "Now I will do as much for
my friend as she did for me; we will have lentils for dinner,
and I will jump into the pot while they are boiling," and she
let the action follow the word, without reflecting that a simple
sausage can do some things which are out of the reach of even
the wisest mouse.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[page&nbsp;51]</span>
<p>
When the sausage came home, she found the house lonely
and silent. She called again and again, "My little mouse!
Mouse of my heart!" but no one answered. Then she went to
look at the lentils boiling on the stove, and, alas! found within
the pot her good little friend, who had perished at the post
of duty.</p>

<p>Poor mousie, with the best intentions in the world, had
stayed too long at her cookery, and when she desired to climb
out of the pot, had no longer the strength to do so.</p>

<p>And the poor sausage could never be consoled! That is
why to-day, when you put one in the pan or on the gridiron,
you will hear her weep and sigh, "M-my p-poor m-mouse!
Ah, m-my p-poor m-mouse!"</p>

<h2>JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE</h2>

<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HERE</b> was once a man who had three sons. Johnny, the
youngest, was always looked upon as the simpleton of the
family, and had very little consideration or kindness shown
him.</p>

<p>It happened one day that the eldest son was going out
into the wood to cut fuel; and before he started, his mother
gave him a slice of rich plum-cake and a flask of wine, so that
he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.</p>

<p>Just as he reached the wood, he met a queer old man,
dressed in gray, who wished him "Good day," and begged
for a piece of the young man's cake and a drink of wine.</p>

<p>But the greedy youth replied: "If I were to give you cake
and wine, I should not have enough left for myself; so be off
with you, and leave me in peace."</p>

<p>Then he pushed the little man rudely on one side and went
his way. He soon came to a likely-looking tree, and began to
hew it down, but he made a false stroke, and instead of striking
<span class="left"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[page&nbsp;52]</span>
the tree he buried his axe in his own arm, and was obliged to
hurry home as fast as he could to have the wound dressed.</p>

<p>And this was what came of offending the little gray man!</p>

<p>The following day the second son set out to the wood, and
his mother treated him just as she had done her eldest son&mdash;gave
him a slice of cake and a flask of wine, in case he should
feel hungry. The little gray man met him at the entrance
to the wood, and begged for a share of his food, but the young
man answered:</p>

<p>"The more I give to you, the less I have for myself. Be
off with you."</p>

<p>Then he left the little gray man standing in the road, and
went on his way. But it was not long before he, too, was
punished; for the first stroke he aimed at a tree glanced aside
and wounded his leg, so that he was obliged to be carried home.</p>

<p>Then said the Simpleton: "Father, let me go to the wood
for once. <i>I</i> will bring you home plenty of fuel."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," answered the father. "Both your brothers
have got into trouble, and it is not likely that I am going to
trust you."</p>

<p>But Johnny would not give up the idea, and worried his
father, till at last he said:</p>

<p>"Very well, my son, have your own way. You shall learn
by experience that I know better than you."</p>

<p>There was no rich cake for the simpleton of the family.
His mother just gave him a little loaf of dough and a bottle of
sour beer.</p>

<p>No sooner did he reach the wood than the little gray man
appeared.</p>

<p>"Give me a piece of your cake and a drink of your wine?"
said he.</p>

<p>But the young man told him he had only a dough loaf and
a bottle of sour beer.</p>

<p>"Still," said he, "you are welcome to a share of the food,
such as it is."</p>

<p>So the two sat down together; but when Johnny took his
humble fare from his pocket, what was his surprise to find it
changed into the most delicious cake and wine. Then the
<span class="left"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[page&nbsp;53]</span>
young man and his guest made a hearty meal, and when it
was ended the little gray man said:</p>

<p>"Because you have such a kind heart, and have willingly
shared your food with me, I am going to reward you. Yonder
stands an old tree: hew it down, and deep in the heart of the
roots you will find something."</p>

<p>The old man then nodded kindly, and disappeared in a
moment.</p>

<p>Johnny at once did as he had been told, and as soon as the
tree fell he saw, sitting in the midst of the roots, a goose with
feathers of purest gold. He lifted it carefully out, and carried
it with him to the inn, where he meant to spend the night.</p>

<p>Now, the landlord had three daughters, and no sooner did
they see the goose than they wanted to know what curious
kind of bird it might be, for never before had they seen a fowl
of any kind with feathers of pure gold. The eldest made up
her mind to wait for a good opportunity and then pluck a
feather for herself. So as soon as Johnny went out of the room
she put out her hand and seized the wing of the goose, but
what was her horror to find that she could not unclasp her
fingers again, nor even move her hand from the golden
goose!</p>

<p>Very soon the second sister came creeping into the room,
meaning also to steal a feather; but no sooner did she touch
her sister than she, too, was unable to draw her hand away.</p>

<p>Lastly came the third, anxious to secure a feather before the
goose's master returned.</p>

<p>"Go away! go away!" screamed her two sisters, but she
could not understand why she should not help herself as well
as the others.</p>

<p>So she paid no heed to their cries, but came toward them and
stretched out her hand to the goose.</p>

<p>In doing so she touched her second sister, and then, alas!
she too, was held fast.</p>

<p>They pulled and tugged with might and main, but it was
all of no use; they could not get away, and there they had to
remain the whole night.</p>

<p>The next morning Johnny tucked the goose under his arm,
<span class="left"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[page&nbsp;54]</span>
and went on his way, never troubling himself about the three
girls hanging on behind.</p>

<p>Then what a dance he led them: over hedges and ditches,
highways and byways! Wherever he led they were bound to
follow. Half way across a sunny meadow, they met the parson,
who was terribly shocked to see the three girls running after a
young man.</p>

<p>"For shame!" he cried angrily, and seized the youngest
by the hand to drag her away.</p>

<p>But no sooner did he touch her than the poor parson was made
fast too, and had to run behind the girls, whether he would or no.</p>

<p>They had scarcely gone half a dozen paces before they met
the sexton, who stared with astonishment to see his master
running at the heels of the three girls.</p>

<p>"Hi! stop, your reverence," he cried. "You will be late
for the christening."</p>

<p>He seized the parson's sleeve as he ran past him, but the
poor sexton had to join the procession too.</p>

<p>So now there were five of them, and just as they turned a
corner the parson saw two peasants, and called to them to set
him and his sexton free.</p>

<p>They threw down their spades at once and tried to do so,
but they too, stuck fast, and so Johnny had a fine string of seven
folk hanging on to the wing of his golden goose.</p>

<p>On and on they ran, until at length they came into the
country of a powerful King.</p>

<p>This King had an only daughter, who all her life had been
so sad that no one had ever been able to make her laugh. So
the King made a decree that the man who could bring a smile
to his daughter's face should have her for his bride.</p>

<p>When Johnny heard what the King had promised, he at
once made his way into the Princess's presence, and when she
saw the goose, with the seven queer-looking companions hanging
on behind, she burst into such a hearty fit of laughter that
it was thought she would never be able to stop again.</p>

<p>Of course, the Simpleton claimed her as his bride, but the
King did not fancy him for a son-in-law, so he made all sorts
of excuses.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[page&nbsp;55]</span>
<p>
"You shall have her," said he, "if you can first bring me
a man who can drink up a whole cellarful of wine."</p>

<p>Johnny at once remembered the little gray man, and,
feeling sure that he would help him, he set out for the wood
where he had first met him.</p>

<p>When he reached the stump of the old tree which he had
himself hewn down, he noticed a man sitting beside it, with a
face as gloomy as a rainy day.</p>

<p>Johnny asked politely what ailed him, and the man
answered:</p>

<p>"I suffer from a thirst I cannot quench. Cold water disagrees
with me, and though I have, it is true, emptied a barrel
of wine, it was no more to me than a single drop of water upon
a hot stone."</p>

<p>You can think how pleased Johnny was to hear these words.
He took the man to the King's cellar, where he seated himself
before the huge barrels, and drank and drank till, at the end
of the day, not a drop of wine was left.</p>

<p>Then Johnny claimed his bride, but the King could not
make up his mind to give his daughter to "a ne'er-do-weel"
who went by such a name as "Simpleton."</p>

<p>So he made fresh excuses, and said that he would not give
her up until the young man had found someone who could eat
up a mountain of bread in a single day.</p>

<p>So the young man had no choice but to set out once more
for the wood.</p>

<p>And again he found a man sitting beside the stump of the
tree. He was very sad and hungry-looking, and sat tightening
the belt round his waist.</p>

<p>"I have eaten a whole ovenful of bread," he said sadly,
"but when one is as hungry as I am, such a meal only serves
to make one more hungry still. I am so empty that if I did not
tighten my belt I should die of hunger."</p>

<p>"You are the man for me!" said Johnny. "Follow me, and
I will give you a meal that will satisfy even your hunger."</p>

<p>He led the man into the courtyard of the King's palace,
where all the meal in the kingdom had been collected together
and mixed into an enormous mountain of bread.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[page&nbsp;56]</span>
<p>
The man from the wood placed himself in front of it and
began to eat, and before the day was over the mountain of bread
had vanished.</p>

<p>A third time the Simpleton demanded his bride, but again
the King found an excuse.</p>

<p>"First bring me a ship that can sail both on land and sea,
and then you shall wed the Princess," he said.</p>

<p>Johnny went straightway to the wood, where he met the
little gray man with whom he had once shared his food.</p>

<p>"Good day," he said, nodding his wise little head. "So
you've come to visit me again, eh? It was I, you know, who
drank the wine and ate the bread for you, and now I will finish
by giving you the wonderful ship which is to sail on either land
or sea. All this I do for you because you were kind and good
to me."</p>

<p>Then he gave him the ship, and when the King saw it he
could find no further excuse.</p>

<p>So he gave the young man his daughter, and the pair were
married that very day.</p>

<p>When the old King died, the Simpleton became King in
his stead, and he and his wife lived happily ever after.</p>

<h2>TITTY MOUSE AND TATTY MOUSE</h2>

<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>ITTY</b> Mouse and Tatty Mouse both lived in a house,</p>

<p>Titty Mouse went a-leasing and Tatty Mouse went a-leasing,</p>

<p>So they both went a-leasing.</p>

<p>Titty Mouse leased an ear of corn, and Tatty Mouse leased an ear of corn,</p>

<p>So they both leased an ear of corn.</p>

<p>Titty Mouse made a pudding, and Tatty Mouse made a pudding,</p>

<p>So they both made a pudding.</p>

<p>And Tatty Mouse put her pudding into the pot to boil,
<span class="left"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[page&nbsp;57]</span>
But, when Titty went to put hers in, the pot tumbled
over, and scalded her to death.</p>

<p>Then Tatty sat down and wept, and a three-legged stool
said: "Tatty, why do you weep?" "Titty's dead," said
Tatty, "and so I weep." "Then," said the stool, "I'll hop."
So the stool hopped.</p>

<p>Then a broom in the corner of the room said: "Stool, why
do you hop?" "Oh!" said the stool, "Titty's dead, and
Tatty weeps, and so I hop." "Then," said the broom, "I'll
sweep." So the broom began to sweep.</p>

<p>"Then," said the door, "Broom, why do you sweep?"
"Oh!" said the broom, "Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and
the stool hops, and so I sweep." "Then," said the door, "I'll
jar." So the door jarred.</p>

<p>"Then," said the window, "Door, why do you jar?"
"Oh!" said the door, "Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and the
stool hops, and the broom sweeps, and so I jar."</p>

<p>"Then," said the window, "I'll creak." So the window
creaked. Now there was an old form outside the house, and
when the window creaked, the form said: "Window, why do
you creak?" "Oh!" said the window, "Titty's dead, and
Tatty weeps, and the stool hops, and the broom sweeps, the
door jars, and so I creak."</p>

<p>"Then," said the old form, "I'll run round the house."
Then the old form ran round the house. Now there was a
fine large walnut-tree growing by the cottage, and the tree
said to the form: "Form, why do you run round the house?"
"Oh!" said the form, "Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and
the stool hops, and the broom sweeps, the door jars, and the
window creaks, and so I run round the house."</p>

<p>"Then," said the walnut-tree, "I'll shed my leaves." So
the walnut-tree shed all its beautiful green leaves. Now there
was a little bird perched on one of the boughs of the tree,
and when all the leaves fell, it said: "Walnut-tree, why do
you shed your leaves?" "Oh!" said the tree, "Titty's dead,
and Tatty weeps, the stool hops, and the broom sweeps, the
door jars, and the window creaks, the old form runs round
the house, and so I shed my leaves."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[page&nbsp;58]</span>
<p>
"Then," said the little bird, "I'll moult all my feathers."
So he moulted all his pretty feathers. Now there was a little
girl walking below, carrying a jug of milk for her brothers'
and sisters' supper, and when she saw the poor little bird
moult all its feathers, she said: "Little bird, why do you
moult all your feathers?" "Oh!" said the little bird, "Titty's
dead, and Tatty weeps, the stool hops, and the broom sweeps,
the door jars, and the window creaks, the old form runs round
the house, the walnut-tree sheds its leaves, and so I moult all
my feathers."</p>

<p>"Then," said the little girl, "I'll spill the milk." So she
dropped the pitcher and spilt the milk. Now there was an old
man just by on the top of a ladder thatching a rick, and when
he saw the little girl spill the milk, he said: "Little girl, what
do you mean by spilling the milk? Your little brothers and
sisters must go without their supper." Then said the little
girl: "Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, the stool hops, and the
broom sweeps, the door jars, and the window creaks, the old
form runs round the house, the walnut-tree sheds all its leaves,
the little bird moults all its feathers, and so I spill the milk."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the old man, "then I'll tumble off the ladder
and break my neck." So he tumbled off the ladder and broke
his neck; and when the old man broke his neck, the great
walnut-tree fell down with a crash, and upset the old form
and house, and the house falling knocked the window out,
and the window knocked the door down, and the door upset
the broom, and the broom upset the stool, and poor little
Tatty Mouse was buried beneath the ruins.</p>

<h2>TEENY TINY</h2>

<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HERE</b> was once upon a time a teeny-tiny woman who lived
in a teeny-tiny house in a teeny-tiny village. Now, one
day this teeny-tiny woman put on her teeny-tiny bonnet, and went
<span class="left"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[page&nbsp;59]</span>
out of her teeny-tiny house to take a teeny-tiny walk. And when
this teeny-tiny woman had gone a teeny-tiny way, she came to a
teeny-tiny gate; so the teeny-tiny woman opened the teeny-tiny
gate, and went into a teeny-tiny churchyard. And when this
teeny-tiny woman had got into the teeny-tiny churchyard, she
saw a teeny-tiny bone on a teeny-tiny grave, and the teeny-tiny
woman said to her teeny-tiny self: "This teeny-tiny bone will
make me some teeny-tiny soup for my teeny-tiny supper." So
the teeny-tiny woman put the teeny-tiny bone into her teeny-tiny
pocket, and went home to her teeny-tiny house.</p>

<p>Now, when the teeny-tiny woman got home to her teeny-tiny
house, she was a teeny-tiny tired; so she went up her teeny-tiny
stairs to her teeny-tiny bed, and put the teeny-tiny bone into a
teeny-tiny cupboard. And when this teeny-tiny woman had
been to sleep a teeny-tiny time, she was awakened by a teeny-tiny
voice from the teeny-tiny cupboard, which said&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc"><b>"give me my bone!"</b></span></p>

<p>And this teeny-tiny woman was a teeny-tiny frightened, so
she hid her teeny-tiny head under the teeny-tiny clothes, and
went to sleep again. And when she had been asleep again a
teeny-tiny time, the teeny-tiny voice cried out from the teeny-tiny
cupboard a teeny-tiny louder&mdash;</p>

<p>This made the teeny-tiny woman a teeny-tiny more frightened,
so she hid her teeny-tiny head a teeny-tiny farther under the
teeny-tiny clothes. And when the teeny-tiny woman had been
asleep again a teeny-tiny time, the teeny-tiny voice from the
teeny-tiny cupboard said again a teeny-tiny louder&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><b>"GIVE ME MY BONE!"</b></span></p>

<p>At this the teeny-tiny woman was a teeny-tiny bit more
frightened; but she put her teeny-tiny head out of the teeny-tiny
clothes, and said in her loudest teeny-tiny voice&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span style="font-size: 1.5em;"><b>"TAKE IT!!"</b></span></p>

<h2>THE SPIDER AND THE FLEA</h2>

<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">A</span></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;SPIDER</b> and a Flea dwelt together in one house, and brewed
their beer in an egg-shell. One day, when the Spider was
stirring it up, she fell in and scalded herself. Thereupon the
Flea began to scream. And then the door asked: "Why are you
screaming, Flea?"</p>

<p>"Because little Spider has scalded herself in the beer-tub,"
replied she.</p>

<p>Thereupon the door began to creak as if it were in pain; and
a broom, which stood in the corner, asked, "What are you
creaking for, door?"</p>

<p>"May I not creak?" it replied:</p>

<div class="poem2">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">"The little Spider's scalt herself,</p>
<p class="i12">    And the Flea weeps."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>So the broom began to sweep industriously, and presently a
little cart came by, and asked the reason.</p>

<p>"May I not sweep?" replied the broom:</p>

<div class="poem2">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">"The little Spider's scalt herself,</p>
<p class="i12">    And the Flea weeps;</p>
<p class="i8">The little door creaks with the pain,"&mdash;</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Thereupon the little cart said: "So will I run," and began to
run very fast, past a heap of ashes, which cried out: "Why do
you run, little cart?"</p>

<p>"Because," replied the cart:</p>

<div class="poem2">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">"The little Spider's scalt herself,</p>
<p class="i12">    And the Flea weeps;</p>
<p class="i8">The little door creaks with the pain,</p>
<p class="i12">    And the broom sweeps."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>"Then," said the ashes, "I will burn furiously." Now,
next the ashes there grew a tree, which asked: "Little heap, why
do you burn?"</p>

<p>"Because," was the reply:</p>

<div class="poem2">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i8"> "The little Spider's scalt herself,</p>
<p class="i12">    And the Flea weeps;</p>
<p class="i8"> The little door creaks with the pain,</p>
<p class="i12">    And the broom sweeps;</p>
<p class="i8"> The little cart runs on so fast,"&mdash;</p>
  </div>  </div>
<span class="left"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[page&nbsp;61]</span>
<p>Thereupon the tree cried, "I will shake myself!" and went on
shaking till all its leaves fell off.</p>

<p>A little girl passing by with a water-pitcher saw it shaking,
and asked: "Why do you shake yourself, little tree?"</p>

<p>"Why may I not?" said the tree:</p>

<div class="poem2">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">"The little Spider's scalt herself,</p>
<p class="i12">    And the Flea weeps;</p>
<p class="i8">The little door creaks with the pain,</p>
<p class="i12">    And the broom sweeps;</p>
<p class="i8">The little cart runs on so fast,</p>
<p class="i12">    And the ashes burn."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Then the maiden said: "If so, I will break my pitcher;" and
she threw it down and broke it.</p>

<p>At this the streamlet, from which she drew the water, asked:</p>

<p>"Why do you break your pitcher, my little girl?"</p>

<p>"Why may I not?" she replied; for</p>

<div class="poem2">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i8"> "The little Spider's scalt herself,</p>
<p class="i12">    And the Flea weeps;</p>

<p class="i8">The little tree shakes down its leaves&mdash;</p>
<p class="i12">    Now it is my turn!"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>"Ah, then," said the streamlet, "now must I begin to flow."
And it flowed and flowed along, in a great stream, which kept
getting bigger and bigger, until at last it swallowed up the little
girl, the little tree, the ashes, the cart, the broom, the door, the
Flea, and, last of all, the Spider, all together.</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY</h2>

<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> upon a time there was a little shepherd boy who
was famed far and wide for the wise answers which he gave
to all questions. Now the King of the country heard of this
lad, but he would not believe what was said about him, so the
boy was ordered to come to court. When he arrived the King
<span class="left"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[page&nbsp;62]</span>
said to him: "If you can give me answers to each of the three
questions which I will now put to you, I will bring you up as
my own child, and you shall live here with me in my palace."</p>

<p>"What are these three questions?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"The first is: How many drops of water are there in the
sea?"</p>

<p>"My lord King," replied the shepherd boy, "let all the
waters be stopped up on the earth, so that not one drop shall
run into the sea before I count it, and then I will tell you how
many drops there are in the sea!"</p>

<p>"The second question," said the King, "is: How many stars
are there in the sky?"</p>

<p>"Give me a large sheet of paper," said the boy; and then
he made in it with a pin so many minute holes that they were far
too numerous to see or to count, and dazzled the eyes of whomsoever
looked at them. This done, he said: "So many stars
are there in the sky as there are holes in this paper; now count
them." But nobody was able. Thereupon the King said:
"The third question is: How many seconds are there in eternity?"</p>

<p>"In Lower Pomerania is situated the adamantine mountain,
one mile in height, one mile in breadth, and one mile deep;
and thither comes a bird once in every thousand years which
rubs its beak against the hill, and, when the whole shall be
rubbed away, then will the first second of eternity be gone
by."</p>

<p>"You have answered the three questions like a sage," said
the King, "and from henceforward you shall live with me in
my palace, and I will treat you as my own child."</p>

<h2>THE THREE SPINNERS</h2>

<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> upon a time there was a lazy maiden who would not
spin, and, let her mother say what she would, she could not
make her do it. At last, the mother, in a fit of impatience,
gave her a blow which made the girl cry out loudly.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[page&nbsp;63]</span>
<p>
At that very instant, the Queen drove by, and, hearing the
screams, she stopped the carriage, came into the house, and
asked the mother why she beat her daughter in such a way
that people in passing could hear the cries.</p>

<p>Then the mother felt ashamed that her daughter's laziness
should be known, so she said: "Oh, your Majesty, I cannot
take her away from her spinning: she spins from morning till
night, and I am so poor that I cannot afford to buy the flax."</p>

<p>"There is nothing I like better than to hear the sound of
spinning," the Queen replied, "and nothing pleases me more
than the whirl of spinning-wheels. Let me take your daughter
home with me to the castle; I have flax enough, and she may
spin there to her heart's content."</p>

<p>The mother rejoiced greatly in her heart, and the Queen
took the maiden home with her. When they arrived in the
castle, she led her up into three rooms, which were piled from
top to bottom with the finest flax.</p>

<p>"Now spin me this flax," said the Queen, "and when thou
has spun it all, thou shalt have my eldest son for a husband.
Although thou art poor, yet I do not despise thee on that account,
for thy untiring industry is dowry enough."</p>

<p>The maiden was filled with inward terror, for she could not
have spun the flax had she sat there day and night until she was
three hundred years old! When she was left alone, she began
to weep, and thus she sat for three days without stirring a finger.</p>

<p>On the third day the Queen came, and when she saw that
nothing was as yet spun, she wondered over it, but the maiden
excused herself by saying that she could not begin in consequence
of the great sorrow she felt in being separated from
her mother.</p>

<p>This satisfied the Queen, who, on leaving her, said:</p>

<p>"Thou must begin to work for me to-morrow."</p>

<p>But when the maiden was once more alone, she did not
know what to do, or how to help herself, and in her distress
she went to the window and looked out. She saw three women
passing by, the first of whom had a great broad foot, the second
such a large under-lip that it hung down to her chin, and the
third an enormous thumb.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[page&nbsp;64]</span>
<p>
They stopped under the window, and, looking up, asked
the maiden what was the matter.</p>

<p>When she had told them of her trouble, they immediately
offered her their help, and said:</p>

<p>"Wilt thou invite us to the wedding, and not be ashamed of
us, but call us thy aunts, and let us sit at thy table? If thou
wilt, we will spin all the flax, and do it in a very short time."</p>

<p>"With all my heart," answered the girl, "only come in, and
begin at once."</p>

<p>Then she admitted the three strange women, and, making
a clear space in the first room, they sat themselves down and
began spinning.</p>

<p>One drew the thread and trod the wheel, the other moistened
the thread, the third pressed it and beat it on the table, and
every time she did so, a pile of thread fell on the ground spun in
the finest way.</p>

<p>The maiden concealed the three spinners from the Queen,
but showed her the heaps of spun yarn whenever she came,
and received no end of praise for it.</p>

<p>When the first room was empty, the second was commenced,
and when that was finished, the third was begun, and very soon
cleared.</p>

<p>Then the three spinners took their leave, saying to the
maiden:</p>

<p>"Forget not what thou hast promised us; it will make thy
fortune."</p>

<p>When the girl showed the Queen the empty rooms and the
great piles of thread, the wedding was announced. The
bridegroom rejoiced that he had won so clever and industrious
a wife, and he praised her exceedingly.</p>

<p>"I have three aunts," said the maiden, "and as they have
done me many kindnesses, I could not forget them in my good
fortune; permit me to invite them to our wedding and allow
them to sit with me at table."</p>

<p>So the Queen and the bridegroom consented.</p>

<p>When the feast commenced, the three old women entered,
clothed in the greatest splendor, and the bride said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Welcome, my dear aunts!"</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[page&nbsp;65]</span>
<p>
"Alas!" exclaimed the bridegroom, "how is it you have such
ugly relations?" and going up to the one with a broad foot, he
asked:</p>

<p>"Why have you such a broad foot?"</p>

<p>"From threading, from threading," she answered.</p>

<p>Then he went to the second, and asked:</p>

<p>"Why have you such an overhanging lip?"</p>

<p>"From moistening the thread," she replied, "from moistening
the thread."</p>

<p>Then he asked the third:</p>

<p>"Why have you such a big thumb?"</p>

<p>"From pressing the thread," answered she.</p>

<p>Then the Prince became frightened, and said:</p>

<p>"Then shall my lovely bride never more turn a spinning-wheel,
as long as she lives!"</p>

<p>Thus was the maiden freed from the hated flax-spinning.</p>

<h2>THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP</h2>

<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">A</span></p>
<p><b>CAT</b> having made the acquaintance of a mouse, told her so
much of the great love and affection that he had for her,
that the mouse at last consented to live in the same house with
him, and to have their domestic affairs in common. "But we
must provide for the winter," said the cat, "or we shall be
starved; you, little mouse, cannot go everywhere looking for
food, or you will meet with an accident."</p>

<p>This advice was followed, and a pot was brought with some
grease in it. However, when they had got it, they could not
imagine where it should be put; but at last, after a long consideration,
the cat said: "I know no better place to put it than
in the church, for there no one dares to steal anything; we will
set it beneath the organ, and not touch it till we really want it."</p>

<p>So the pot was put away in safety; but not long afterward the
<span class="left"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[page&nbsp;66]</span>
cat began to wish for it again, so he spoke to the mouse and said:
"I have to tell you that I am asked by my aunt to stand godfather
to a little son, white with brown marks, whom she has
just brought into the world, and so I must go to the christening.
Let me go out to-day, and do you stop at home and keep house."</p>

<p>"Certainly," answered the mouse; "pray, go; and if you eat
anything nice, think of me; I would also willingly drink a little
of the sweet red christening-wine."</p>

<p>But, alas! it was all a story; for the cat had no aunt, and had
not been asked to stand godfather to any one. He went straight
to the church, crept up to the grease-pot, and licked it till he had
eaten off the top; then he took a walk on the roofs of the
houses in the town, thinking over his situation, and now and
then stretching himself in the sun and stroking his whiskers as
often as he thought of his meal. When it was evening he
went home again, and the mouse said: "So you have come at
last; what a charming day you must have had!"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the cat; "it went off very well!"</p>

<p>"What have you named the kitten?" asked the mouse.</p>

<p>"<i>Top-off</i>," said the cat very quickly.</p>

<p>"<i>Top-off!</i>" replied the mouse; "that is a curious and remarkable
name; is it common in your family?"</p>

<p>"What does that matter?" said the cat; "it is not worse than
Crumb-stealer, as your children are called."</p>

<p>Not long afterward the cat felt the same longing as before,
and said to the mouse: "You must oblige me by taking care of the
house once more by yourself; I am again asked to stand godfather,
and, since the youngster has a white ring round his neck,
I cannot get off the invitation." So the good little mouse consented,
and the cat crept away behind the wall to the church
again, and ate half the contents of the grease-pot. "Nothing
tastes better than what one eats by one's self," said he, quite
contented with his day's work; and when he came home the
mouse asked how this child was named.</p>

<p>"<i>Half-out</i>," answered the cat.</p>

<p>"<i>Half-out!</i> What do you mean? I never heard such a
name before in my life; I will wager anything it is not in the
calendar," but the cat replied nothing.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[page&nbsp;67]</span>
<p>
Pussy's mouth soon began to water again at the recollection
of the feasting. "All good things come in threes," said he
to the mouse. "I am again required to be godfather; this
child is quite black, and has little white claws, but not a single
white hair on his body; such a thing only happens once in two
years, so pray excuse me this time."</p>

<p>"<i>Top-off! Half-out!</i>" answered the mouse; "those are such
curious names, they make me a bit suspicious."</p>

<p>"Ah!" replied the cat, "there you sit in your gray coat and
long tail, thinking nonsense. That comes of never going out."</p>

<p>The mouse busied herself during the cat's absence in putting
the house in order, but meanwhile greedy puss licked the grease-pot
clean out. "When it is all done one will rest in peace,"
thought he to himself, and as soon as night came he went home
fat and tired. The mouse, however, again asked what name
the third child had received. "It will not please you any better,"
answered the cat, "for he is called <i>All-out.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>All-out!</i>" exclaimed the mouse; "well, that is certainly the
most curious name by far. I have never yet seen it in print.
<i>All-out!</i> What can that mean?" and, shaking her head, she
rolled herself up and went to sleep.</p>

<p>After that nobody else asked the cat to stand godfather; but
the winter had arrived, and nothing more was to be picked up
out of doors; so the mouse bethought herself of their store of
provision, and said, "Come, friend cat, we will go to our grease-pot
which we laid by; it will taste well now."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," replied the cat; "it will taste as well as if you
stroked your tongue against the window."</p>

<p>So they set out on their journey, and when they arrived at
the church the pot stood in its old place&mdash;but it was empty!
"Ah," said the mouse, "I see what has happened; now I know
you are indeed a faithful friend. You have eaten the whole as
you stood godfather; first <i>Top-off,</i> then <i>Half-out,</i> then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you be quiet?" cried the cat. "Not a word, or I'll eat
you." But the poor mouse had "<i>All-out"</i> at her tongue's end,
and had scarcely uttered it when the cat made a spring, seized
her in his mouth, and swallowed her.</p>

<p>This happens every day in the world.</p>

<h2>THE SWEET SOUP</h2>

<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> on a time there was a poor but very good little girl,
who lived alone with her mother, and when my story begins,
they had nothing in the house to eat. So the child went out
into the forest, and there she met an old woman, who already
knew her distress, and who presented her with a pot which had
the following power. If one said to it, "Boil, little pot!" it
would cook sweet soup; and when one said: "Stop, little pot!"
it would immediately cease to boil. The little girl took the
pot home to her mother, and now their poverty and distresses
were at an end, for they could have sweet broth as often as they
pleased.</p>

<p>One day, however, the little girl went out, and in her absence
the mother said: "Boil, little pot!" So it began to cook,
and she soon ate all she wished; but when the poor woman
wanted to have the pot stop, she found she did not know the
word. Away, therefore, the pot boiled, and very quickly was
over the edge; and as it boiled and boiled the kitchen presently
became full, then the house, and the next house, and soon the
whole street. It seemed likely to satisfy all the world, for,
though there was the greatest necessity to do so, nobody knew
how to stop it. At last, when only a very small cottage of all
the village was left unfilled with soup, the child returned and
said at once: "Stop, little pot!"</p>

<p>Immediately it ceased to boil; but whoever wishes to enter
the village now must eat his way through the soup!!!</p>

<h2>THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN</h2>

<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">A</span></p>
<p><b>LL</b> alone, in a quiet little village, lived a poor old woman.
One day she had a dish of beans which she wanted to cook
for dinner, so she made a fire on the hearth, and in order that it
should burn up quickly she lighted it with a handful of
straw.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[page&nbsp;69]</span>
<p>
She hung the pot over the fire, and poured in the beans;
but one fell on to the floor without her noticing it, and rolled
away beside a piece of straw. Soon afterwards a live coal
flew out of the fire and joined their company. Then the straw
began to speak.</p>

<p>"Dear friends," said he, "whence come you?"</p>

<p>"I was fortunate enough to spring out of the fire," answered
the coal. "Had I not exerted myself to get out when I did,
I should most certainly have been burnt to ashes."</p>

<p>"I have also just managed to save my skin," said the bean.
"Had the old woman succeeded in putting me into the pot, I
should have been stewed without mercy, just as my comrades
are being served now."</p>

<p>"My fate might have been no better," the straw told them.
"The old woman burnt sixty of my brothers at once, but
fortunately I was able to slip through her fingers."</p>

<p>"What shall we do now?" said the coal.</p>

<p>"Well," answered the bean, "my opinion is that, as we
have all been so fortunate as to escape death, we should leave
this place before any new misfortune overtakes us. Let us
all three become traveling companions and set out upon a
journey to some unknown country."</p>

<p>This suggestion pleased both the straw and the coal, so
away they all went at once. Before long they came to a brook,
and as there was no bridge across it they did not know how to
get to the other side; but the straw had a good idea: "I will
lay myself over the water, and you can walk across me as though
I were a bridge," he said. So he stretched himself from one
bank to the other, and the coal, who was of a hasty disposition,
at once tripped gaily on to the newly-built bridge. Half way
across she hesitated, and began to feel afraid of the rushing
water beneath her. She dared go no farther, but neither would
she return; but she stood there so long that the straw caught
fire, broke in two, and fell into the stream. Of course, the coal
was bound to follow. No sooner did she touch the water than&mdash;hiss,
zish! out she went, and never glowed again.</p>

<p>The bean, who was a careful fellow, had stayed on the bank,
to watch how the coal got across, before trusting himself to
<span class="left"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[page&nbsp;70]</span>
such a slender bridge. But when he saw what very queer
figures his friends cut, he could not help laughing. He laughed
and laughed till he could not stop, and at length he split his
side.</p>

<p>It would have gone badly with him then, had not a tailor
happened to pass by. He was a kind-hearted fellow, and at
once took out his needle and thread and began to repair the
mischief.</p>

<p>The bean thanked him politely, for he knew that the tailor
had saved his life, but unfortunately he had used black thread,
and from that time till to-day every bean has a little black
stitch in its side.</p>

<h2>WHY THE BEAR HAS A STUMPY TAIL</h2>

<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NE</b> winter's day the bear met the fox, who came slinking
along with a string of fish he had stolen.</p>

<p>"Hi! stop a minute! Where did you get those from?"
demanded the bear.</p>

<p>"Oh, my Lord Bruin, I've been out fishing and caught
them," said the fox.</p>

<p>So the bear had a mind to learn to fish, too, and bade the
fox tell him how he was to set about it.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is quite easy," answered the fox, "and soon learned.
You've only got to go upon the ice, and cut a hole and stick
your tail down through it, and hold it there as long as you
can. You're not to mind if it smarts a little; that's when the
fish bite. The longer you hold it there, the more fish you'll
get; and then all at once out with it, with a cross pull side ways
and a strong pull, too."</p>

<p>Well, the bear did as the fox said, and though he felt very
cold, and his tail smarted very much, he kept it a long, long
time down in the hole, till at last it was frozen in, though of
<span class="left"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[page&nbsp;71]</span>
course he did not know that. Then he pulled it out with a
strong pull, and it snapped short off, and that's why Bruin
goes about with a stumpy tail to this day!</p>

<h2>THE THREE LITTLE PIGS</h2>

<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> upon a time, when pigs could talk and no one had ever
heard of bacon, there lived an old piggy mother with her
three little sons.</p>

<p>They had a very pleasant home in the middle of an oak forest,
and were all just as happy as the day was long, until one sad
year the acorn crop failed; then, indeed, poor Mrs. Piggy-wiggy
often had hard work to make both ends meet.</p>

<p>One day she called her sons to her, and, with tears in her eyes,
told them that she must send them out into the wide world to seek
their fortune.</p>

<p>She kissed them all round, and the three little pigs set out upon
their travels, each taking a different road, and carrying a
bundle slung on a stick across his shoulder.</p>

<p>The first little pig had not gone far before he met a man
carrying a bundle of straw; so he said to him: "Please, man,
give me that straw to build me a house?" The man was very
good-natured, so he gave him the bundle of straw, and the little
pig built a pretty little house with it.</p>

<p>No sooner was it finished, and the little pig thinking of going
to bed, than a wolf came along, knocked at the door, and said:
"Little pig, little pig, let me come in."</p>

<p>But the little pig laughed softly, and answered: "No, no, by
the hair of my chinny-chin-chin."</p>

<p>Then said the wolf sternly: "I will <i>make</i> you let me in; for I'll
huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in!"</p>

<p>So he huffed and he puffed, and he blew his house in, because,
you see, it was only of straw and too light; and when he had
<span class="left"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[page&nbsp;72]</span>
blown the house in, he ate up the little pig, and did not leave so
much as the tip of his tail.</p>

<p>The second little pig also met a man, and <i>he</i> was carrying a
bundle of furze; so piggy said politely: "Please, kind man, will
you give me that furze to build me a house?"</p>

<p>The man agreed, and piggy set to work to build himself a snug
little house before the night came on. It was scarcely finished
when the wolf came along, and said: "Little pig, little pig, let me
come in."</p>

<p>"No, no, by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin," answered the
second little pig.</p>

<p>"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in!"
said the wolf. So he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed, and
he huffed, and at last he blew the house in, and gobbled the little
pig up in a trice.</p>

<p>Now, the third little pig met a man with a load of bricks and
mortar, and he said: "Please, man, will you give me those
bricks to build a house with?"</p>

<p>So the man gave him the bricks and mortar, and a little trowel
as well, and the little pig built himself a nice strong little house.
As soon as it was finished the wolf came to call, just as he had
done to the other little pigs, and said: "Little pig, little pig, let
me in!"</p>

<p>But the little pig answered: "No, no, by the hair of my
chinny-chin-chin."</p>

<p>"Then," said the wolf, "I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow
your house in."</p>

<p>Well, he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed, and he huffed,
and he huffed, and he puffed; but he could <i>not</i> get the house
down. At last he had no breath left to huff and puff with,
so he sat down outside the little pig's house and thought for
awhile.</p>

<p>Presently he called out: "Little pig, I know where there is a
nice field of turnips."</p>

<p>"Where?" said the little pig.</p>

<p>"Behind the farmer's house, three fields away, and if you will
be ready to-morrow morning I will call for you, and we will go
together and get some breakfast."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[page&nbsp;73]</span>
<p>
"Very well," said the little pig; "I will be sure to be ready.
What time do you mean to start?"</p>

<p>"At six o'clock," replied the wolf.</p>

<p>Well, the wise little pig got up at five, scampered away to the
field, and brought home a fine load of turnips before the wolf
came. At six o'clock the wolf came to the little pig's house and
said: "Little pig, are you ready?"</p>

<p>"Ready!" cried the little pig. "Why, I have been to the
field and come back long ago, and now I am busy boiling a potful
of turnips for breakfast."</p>

<p>The wolf was very angry indeed; but he made up his mind to
catch the little pig somehow or other; so he told him that he
knew where there was a nice apple-tree.</p>

<p>"Where?" said the little pig.</p>

<p>"Round the hill in the squire's orchard," the wolf said. "So
if you will promise to play me no tricks, I will come for you tomorrow
morning at five o'clock, and we will go there together
and get some rosy-cheeked apples."</p>

<p>The next morning piggy got up at four o'clock and was off
and away long before the wolf came.</p>

<p>But the orchard was a long way off, and besides, he had the
tree to climb, which is a difficult matter for a little pig, so that before
the sack he had brought with him was quite filled he saw the
wolf coming towards him.</p>

<p>He was dreadfully frightened, but he thought it better to put
a good face on the matter, so when the wolf said: "Little pig, why
are you here before me? Are they nice apples?" he replied at
once: "Yes, very; I will throw down one for you to taste." So
he picked an apple and threw it so far that whilst the wolf was
running to fetch it he had time to jump down and scamper away
home.</p>

<p>The next day the wolf came again, and told the little pig that
there was going to be a fair in the town that afternoon, and asked
him if he would go with him.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," said the pig, "I will go with pleasure. What
time will you be ready to start?"</p>

<p>"At half-past three," said the wolf.</p>

<p>Of course, the little pig started long before the time, went to
<span class="left"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[page&nbsp;74]</span>
the fair, and bought a fine large butter-churn, and was trotting
away with it on his back when he saw the wolf coming.</p>

<p>He did not know what to do, so he crept into the churn to hide,
and by so doing started it rolling.</p>

<p>Down the hill it went, rolling over and over, with the little pig
squeaking inside.</p>

<p>The wolf could not think what the strange thing rolling down
the hill could be; so he turned tail and ran away home in a fright
without ever going to the fair at all. He went to the little pig's
house to tell him how frightened he had been by a large round
thing which came rolling past him down the hill.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed the little pig; "so I frightened you, eh?
I had been to the fair and bought a butter-churn; when I saw
you I got inside it and rolled down the hill."</p>

<p>This made the wolf so angry that he declared that he <i>would</i>
eat up the little pig, and that nothing should save him, for he
would jump down the chimney.</p>

<p>But the clever little pig hung a pot full of water over the
hearth and then made a blazing fire, and just as the wolf was
coming down the chimney he took off the cover and in fell the
wolf. In a second the little pig had popped the lid on again.</p>

<p>Then he boiled the wolf, and ate him for supper, and after
that he lived quietly and comfortably all his days, and was never
troubled by a wolf again.</p>

<h3>THE SPIDER AND THE FLY</h3>
  <div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Will you walk into my parlor?" said the spider to the fly;</p>
<p>"'Tis the prettiest little parlor that ever you did spy.</p>
<p>The way into my parlor is up a winding stair,</p>
<p>And I have many curious things to show when you are there."</p>
<p>"Oh no, no," said the little fly; "to ask me is in vain,</p>
<p>For who goes up your winding stair can ne'er come down again."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"I'm sure you must be weary, dear, with soaring up so high.</p>
<p>Will you rest upon my little bed?" said the spider to the fly.</p>
<p>"There are pretty curtains drawn around; the sheets are fine and thin,</p>
<p>And if you like to rest a while, I'll snugly tuck you in!"</p>
<p>"Oh no, no," said the little fly, "for I've often heard it said,</p>
<p>They never, never wake again who sleep upon your bed!"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Said the cunning spider to the fly: "Dear friend, what can I do</p>
<p>To prove the warm affection I've always felt for you?</p>
<p>I have within my pantry good store of all that's nice;</p>
<p>I'm sure you're very welcome&mdash;will you please to take a slice?"</p>
<p>"Oh no, no," said the little fly; "kind sir, that cannot be:</p>
<p>I've heard what's in your pantry, and I do not wish to see!"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"Sweet creature!" said the spider, "you're witty and you're wise;</p>
<p>How handsome are your gauzy wings; how brilliant are your eyes!</p>
<p>I have a little looking-glass upon my parlor shelf;</p>
<p>If you'll step in one moment, dear, you shall behold yourself."</p>
<p>"I thank you, gentle sir," she said, "for what you're pleased to say,</p>
<p>And, bidding you good morning now, I'll call another day."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[page&nbsp;110]</span>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The spider turned him round about, and went into his den,</p>
<p>For well he knew the silly fly would soon come back again:</p>
<p>So he wove a subtle web in a little corner sly,</p>
<p>And set his table ready to dine upon the fly;</p>
<p>Then came out to his door again, and merrily did sing:</p>
<p>"Come hither, hither, pretty fly, with pearl and silver wing;</p>
<p>Your robes are green and purple; there's a crest upon your head;</p>
<p>Your eyes are like the diamond bright, but mine are dull as lead!"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Alas, alas! how very soon this silly little fly,</p>
<p>Hearing his wily, flattering words, came slowly flitting by;</p>
<p>With buzzing wings she hung aloft, then near and nearer drew,</p>
<p>Thinking only of her brilliant eyes and green and purple hue,</p>
<p>Thinking only of her crested head. Poor, foolish thing! at last</p>
<p>Up jumped the cunning spider, and fiercely held her fast;</p>
<p>He dragged her up his winding stair, into the dismal den&mdash;</p>
<p>Within his little parlor&mdash;but she ne'er came out again!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And now, dear little children, who may this story read,</p>
<p>To idle, silly, flattering words I pray you ne'er give heed;</p>
<p>Unto an evil counselor close heart and ear and eye,</p>
<p>And take a lesson from this tale of the spider and the fly.</p>

<h2>CHILDREN'S FAVORITE STORIES</h2>

<hr class="short" />




<h2>HANSEL AND GRETEL</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">M</span></p>
<p><b>ANY</b> years ago, a woodcutter and his wife, with their two
children, Hansel and Gretel, lived upon the outskirts of a
dense wood. They were very poor, so that when a famine fell
upon the land, and bread became dear, they could no longer
afford to buy sufficient food for the whole family.</p>

<p>One night, as the poor man lay tossing on his hard bed, he
cried aloud in his grief and anguish:</p>

<p>"Alas! what will become of us? How can I feed my hungry
little ones when we have no food for ourselves?"</p>

<p>"Listen to me, good-man," answered his wife, who was stepmother
to the children. "As it is no longer possible for us to
keep our children, we will take them into the wood with us tomorrow,
light a fire for them, and give each a piece of bread and
leave them. They will not easily find their way back, and so we
shall be rid of the burden of them."</p>

<p>But the father said: "No, no! I could not find it in my heart
to leave my darlings to perish. The wild beasts would tear them
limb from limb."</p>

<p>"Then," answered the wife, "we must all four die of hunger."
She gave her husband no peace until he promised to do as
she wished, and at last, very unwillingly, he consented.</p>

<p>Now, the two children had been too hungry to go to sleep that
night, and so it happened that they overheard all that their parents
were saying. Gretel wept bitterly, but brave little Hansel
did his best to comfort her. "Don't be afraid," he said; "I will
take care of you."</p>

<p>As soon as his father and stepmother were asleep, he slipped
on his coat, and-opening the door softly, went out into the
<span class="left"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[page&nbsp; 114]</span>
garden. The moon was shining brightly, and by its light he
could see the little white pebbles that lay scattered in front of the
house, shining like little pieces of silver. He stooped and filled
his pockets as full as he could, and then went back to Gretel, and
once more bidding her be comforted, for God would be sure to
watch over them, he jumped into bed, and they both fell fast
asleep.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, before the sun had risen, the stepmother
came and wakened the children. "Rise, little lie-a-beds,"
she said, "and come with us into the wood to gather fuel."</p>

<p>She gave them each a piece of bread for their dinner, and told
them to be sure not to eat it too soon, for they would get nothing
more.</p>

<p>Gretel carried the bread in her pinafore, because Hansel had
his pockets full, and then they all set out upon their way to the
wood.</p>

<p>As they trudged along, the father noticed that his little son
kept turning back to look at the house. "Take care, my boy,"
he said, "or you will slip. What are you looking at so earnestly?"</p>

<p>"I am watching my kitten, father: she is sitting on the roof to
bid me good-by."</p>

<p>"Silly little lad, that is not your cat," said the stepmother;
"it is only the morning sun shining on the chimney."</p>

<p>But Hansel had not been watching his cat at all; he had
stayed behind to drop the pebbles upon the path.</p>

<p>When they reached the thickest part of the forest, the father
bade the children gather wood, that he might kindle a fire for
them, so that they might rest beside it and warm themselves
whilst he and his wife were cutting the fuel. So they gathered a
pile of brushwood and twigs, and as soon as it was well alight, the
parents left them, promising to return as soon as they had finished
their work.</p>

<p>Hansel and Gretel sat down by the fire, and when midday
came they ate their bread and sat listening to the strokes of their
father's axe, thinking all the time that he was near to them. But
what they heard was only a dry branch which the man had
bound to a tree, so that the wind swung it hither and thither, and
<span class="left"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[page&nbsp; 115]</span>
the noise it made deceived the children. At last the poor, tired,
little eyelids closed, and, side by side, brother and sister fell
asleep.</p>

<p>When they awoke, the night was very dark, and Gretel was
frightened, and began to cry. Hansel put his arms around her
and whispered. "Wait, dearie, till the moon rises; we shall soon
find our way home then."</p>

<p>As soon as the bright moon rose, Hansel took his little sister
by the hand, and all night long they followed the track of the
little white pebbles, until at daybreak they came to their father's
house.</p>

<p>They knocked at the door, and no sooner did the stepmother
open it than she began to scold them for having stayed out so
long in the wood; but the father greeted them kindly, for he had
grieved sorely for his little ones.</p>

<p>In a short time they were as badly off as ever, and one night
they again heard their mother trying to persuade her husband to
take them out into the wood and lose them. "There is nothing
left in the house but half a loaf of bread," she said; "for our own
sakes it is better to get rid of the children; but this time we will
lead them farther away, so that they will not be able to find their
way home."</p>

<p>But the man would not agree. "Better to divide our last
morsel with them," he said, "and then die together."</p>

<p>His wife would not listen to what he said, but scolded him
for his want of thought for her; and at last the poor man gave
way a second time, just as he had done at first.</p>

<p>But the children had overheard all that was said, and as soon
as the mother and father were asleep, Hansel stole down to the
door, meaning to go and collect pebbles as he had done before;
but the door was locked and bolted, and he could not get out.
"Never mind, Gretel," he said consolingly, "the good God will
surely help us."</p>

<p>Early in the morning the woman wakened the children, and,
giving them a small piece of bread, bade them follow her and
their father into the wood. As they went, Hansel crumbled his
morsel of bread in his pocket and strewed the crumbs upon the
path.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[page&nbsp; 116]</span>
<p>
"Come, Hansel," said the father, "don't loiter so, sonny.
What can you see to stare at so often?"</p>

<p>"My little dove, father. It is sitting on the housetop, bidding
me good-by."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said the woman, "it is not your dove; it is only
the rising sun shining upon the chimney."</p>

<p>Hansel did not answer, but he went on strewing his crumbs
carefully until the last morsel of bread was gone.</p>

<p>Deeper and deeper into the wood they went, where the children
had never been before. There a great fire was kindled,
and the mother said: "Stay here, children, whilst your father and
I go to cut wood. If you are tired you may sleep a while, and
we will fetch you when it is time to go home."</p>

<p>When dinner-time came, Gretel divided her piece of bread
with Hansel, because he had scattered all his share upon the
road; and then they went to sleep. The evening shadows fell,
but still no one came to fetch the poor children, and it was not
until midnight that they awakened.</p>

<p>Hansel put his arms round his sister and told her not to fear,
for when the moon rose they would easily be able to see the
crumbs, and so find their way home again.</p>

<p>So when the moon rose they set out upon their way; but alas!
there were no crumbs to be seen, for the little birds that lived in
the green wood were as hungry as the children, and had eaten
them all up.</p>

<p>"We will find the way somehow," cried cheerful little Hansel;
but though they traveled all night long, and the next day too,
they could not find it. Poor little mites, how tired and hungry
they were, for they had nothing to eat but the berries that grew
by the roadside!</p>

<p>When at length the weary little feet could go no farther, the
children lay down beneath a tree and slept.</p>

<p>On the third day they were still as far away as ever, and it
seemed to them that the longer they walked the deeper they got
into the wood, and they began to be afraid that they would die of
cold and hunger.</p>

<p>But presently, when the midday sun was shining brightly,
they noticed a little snow-white bird singing so sweetly that they
<span class="left"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[page&nbsp; 117]</span>
could not help but stay to listen. When the birdie's song was
ended, he spread his wings and flew away.</p>

<p>The children followed him until they reached a little house,
on the roof of which he perched. Then the children saw with
surprise that the strange little house was built entirely of bread,
roofed with cakes, and with windows of barley sugar.</p>

<p>"See, Gretel," cried Hansel joyfully, "there is food for us in
plenty. I will take a piece of the roof, and you shall have one of
the windows."</p>

<p>He stretched out his hand to help himself, and Gretel had already
begun to nibble one of the window-panes, when suddenly
they heard a voice call from within:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Nibbly, nibbly, mouse!</p>
<p>Who's nibbling at my house?"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The children answered quickly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"'Tis my Lady Wind that blows,</p>
<p>As round about the house she goes."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>And then they went on eating as though nothing had happened
for the cake of which the roof was made just suited Hansel's
taste, whilst the barley-sugar window-panes were better
than any sweetmeat Gretel had ever tasted before.</p>

<a name="page117a" id="page117a"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/0564.jpg"><img src="images/0564-321.jpg" width="321" height="450" alt="Hansel and Gretel." border="0" /></a><br /><br />
<p class="center"><b>Hansel and Gretel.</b></p>
</div>

<p>All at once the door of the cottage flew wide open, and out
came an old, old woman, leaning upon a crutch. The children
were so frightened that they dropped their food and clung to
each other.</p>

<p>The old woman nodded her head to them, and said: "Who
brought you here, my pets? Come inside, come inside; no one
will hurt you."</p>

<p>She took their hands and led them into the house, and set
before them all kinds of delicious foods, milk, sugared pancakes,
apples, and nuts. When they had finished their meal she
showed them two cosy little white beds, and as Hansel and
Gretel lay snugly tucked up in them, they thought to themselves
that surely they had now found the most delightful place in the
whole wide world.</p>

<p>But the old woman had only pretended to be friendly and
kind, for she was really a wicked old witch, who was always
<span class="left"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[page&nbsp; 118]</span>
lying in wait to catch little children, indeed, she had built the
little house of bread and cakes especially to entice them in.
Whenever anyone came into her power, she cooked and ate him,
and thought what a fine feast she had had.</p>

<p>Witches have red eyes and cannot see far, but they have keen
scent, like animals, and can tell at once when a human being is
near to them.</p>

<p>As soon as Hansel and Gretel came into her neighborhood
she laughed to herself and said mockingly: "Ha, ha! they are
mine already; they will not easily escape me."</p>

<p>Early in the morning, before the children were awake, she stood
beside them and admired their rosy cheeks and soft round limbs.</p>

<p>"What nice tit-bits for me," murmured she. Then, seizing
Hansel by the hand, she led him to a little stable, and, in spite of
his cries and screams, shut him up and left him. Then she
shook Gretel until she was awake, and bade her get up at once
and carry food and drink to her brother, and it must be of the
best too, for she wished to fatten him.</p>

<p>"When he is nice and plump, I shall eat him," said the cruel
old witch. Gretel wept bitterly, but it was quite in vain, for
she was obliged to do the witch's bidding; and every day she
cooked the choicest food for her brother, while she herself lived
upon nothing but oyster-shells.</p>

<p>Day by day the old woman visited the stable and called to
Hansel to put his finger through the window bars, that she might
see if he were getting fat; but the little fellow held out a bone instead,
and as her eyes were dim with age, she mistook the bone
for the boy's finger, and thought how thin and lean he was.
When a whole month had passed without Hansel becoming the
least bit fatter, the old witch lost patience and declared she would
wait no longer. "Hurry, Gretel," she said to the little girl,
"fill the pot with water, for to-morrow, be he lean or fat, Hansel
shall be cooked for my dinner."</p>

<p>The tears chased each other down Gretel's cheeks as she
carried in the water, and she sobbed aloud in her grief. "Dear
God," she cried, "we have no one to help us but Thou. Alas!
if only the wild beasts in the wood had devoured us, at least we
should have died together."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[page&nbsp; 119]</span>
<p>
"Cease your chattering," cried the old witch angrily. "It
will not help you, so you may as well be still."</p>

<p>The next morning poor Gretel was forced to light the fire and
hang the great pot of water over it, and then the witch said:
"First we will bake. I have kneaded the dough, and heated the
oven; you shall creep inside it to see if it is hot enough to bake
the bread."</p>

<p>But Gretel guessed that the old witch meant to shut the door
upon her and roast her, so she pretended that she did not know
how to get in.</p>

<p>"Silly goose," said the witch. "The door is wide enough, to
be sure. Why, even I could get inside it." As she spoke, she
popped her head into the oven. In a moment Gretel sprang
towards her, pushed her inside, shut the iron door, and shot the
bolt. Oh! how she squealed and shrieked, but Gretel ran off
as fast as she could, and so there was an end of the cruel old
witch.</p>

<p>Quick as thought, Gretel ran to her brother. "We are
saved, Hansel," she cried, opening the door of the stable, "the
wicked old witch is dead."</p>

<p>Hansel flew from his prison as a bird from its cage, and the
two happy little children kissed each other and jumped for joy.
No longer afraid of the old witch, they entered the house, hand
in hand, and then they saw that in every corner of the room were
boxes of pearls and diamonds, and all kinds of precious gems.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Hansel merrily, "these are better than pebbles,
Gretel," and he stuffed his pockets with the jewels, whilst
Gretel filled her pinafore. "Now," said Hansel, "we will leave
the witch's wood behind us as fast as we can."</p>

<p>So off they ran, and never stopped until they came to a lake,
upon which swam a large white duck.</p>

<p>"How can we cross," said Hansel, "for there is no bridge
anywhere?"</p>

<p>"And no ship either," Gretel answered; "but we will ask
the pretty white duck to carry us over." So they cried aloud:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Little duck, little duck,</p>
<p>With wings so white,</p>
<p>Carry us over</p>
<p>The waters bright."</p>
  </div>  </div>
<span class="left"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[page&nbsp; 120]</span>
<p>The duck came at once, and, taking Hansel upon her back,
carried him over to the other side, and then did the same for
Gretel. They went merrily on their way, and very soon they
found themselves in a part of the wood they knew quite well.</p>

<p>When they saw the roof of their father's house in the distance
they began to run, and, breathless with haste, half laughing
and half crying, they rushed into the cottage and flung themselves
into their father's arms.</p>

<p>Oh! how pleased he was to see them once again, for he had
not known a happy hour since he had left them alone in the
wood. Gretel shook out her pinafore, and Hansel emptied his
pockets, and the floor of the little room was quite covered with
glittering precious stones.</p>

<p>So now their troubles were at an end, for the cruel stepmother
was dead, and Hansel and Gretel and their father lived
together happily ever after.</p>

<p>My story is ended, and see, there runs a little mouse, and the
first who catches him shall have a fur cap made from his skin.</p>

<h2>THE WOLF AND THE FOX</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">A</span></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;WOLF</b>, once upon a time, caught a fox. It happened one
day that they were both going through the forest, and the
wolf said to his companion: "Get me some food, or I will eat
you up."</p>

<p>The fox replied: "I know a farmyard where there are a
couple of young lambs, which, if you wish, we will fetch."</p>

<p>This proposal pleased the wolf, so they went, and the fox,
stealing first one of the lambs, brought it to the wolf, and then
ran away. The wolf devoured it quickly, but was not contented,
and went to fetch the other lamb by himself, but he did
it so awkwardly that he aroused the attention of the mother,
who began to cry and bleat loudly, so that the peasants ran up.
There they found the wolf, and beat him so unmercifully that
he ran, howling and limping, to the fox, and said: "You have
led me to a nice place, for, when I went to fetch the other lamb,
the peasants came and beat me terribly!"</p>

<p>"Why are you such a glutton, then?" asked the fox.</p>

<p>The next day they went again into the fields, and the covetous
wolf said to the fox: "Get me something to eat now, or I will
devour you!"</p>

<p>The fox said he knew a country house where the cook was
going that evening to make some pancakes, and thither they went.
When they arrived, the fox sneaked and crept around round the
house, until he at last discovered where the dish was standing,
out of which he stole six pancakes, and took them to the wolf,
saying, "There is something for you to eat!" and then ran
away. The wolf dispatched these in a minute or two, and,
wishing to taste some more, he went and seized the dish, but
took it away so hurriedly that it broke in pieces. The noise of
its fall brought out the woman, who, as soon as she saw the
wolf, called her people, who, hastening up, beat him with such
a good will that he ran home to the fox, howling, with two
lame legs! "What a horrid place you have drawn me into
now," cried he; "the peasants have caught me, and dressed my
skin finely!"</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[page&nbsp; 123]</span>

<p>"Why, then, are you such a glutton?" said the fox.</p>

<p>When they went out again the third day, the wolf limping
along with weariness, he said to the fox: "Get me something
to eat now, or I will devour you!"</p>

<p>The fox said he knew a man who had just killed a pig, and
salted the meat down in a cask in his cellar, and that they could
get at it. The wolf replied that he would go with him on condition
that he helped him if he could not escape. "Oh, of
course I will, on mine own account!" said the fox, and showed
him the tricks and ways by which they could get into the cellar.
When they went in there was meat in abundance, and the
wolf was enraptured at the sight. The fox, too, had a taste,
but kept looking round while eating, and ran frequently to the
hole by which they had entered, to see if his body would slip
through it easily. Presently the wolf asked: "Why are you
running about so, you fox, jumping in and out?" "I want
to see if any one is coming," replied the fox cunningly; "but
mind you do not eat too much!"</p>

<p>The wolf said he would not leave till the cask was quite
empty; and meanwhile the peasant, who had heard the noise
made by the fox, entered the cellar. The fox, as soon as he saw
him, made a spring, and was through the hole in a jiffy; and the
wolf tried to follow his example, but he had eaten so much that
his body was too big for the opening, and he stuck fast. Then
came the peasant with a cudgel, and beat him sorely; but the
fox leaped away into the forest, very glad to get rid of the old
glutton.</p>

<h2>DISCREET HANS</h2>

<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">H</span></p>
<p><b>ANS'S</b> mother asked: "Whither are you going, Hans?"
"To Grethel's," replied he. "Behave well, Hans." "I
will take care; good-by, mother." "Good-by, Hans."</p>

<p>Hans came to Grethel. "Good day," said he. "Good
<span class="left"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[page&nbsp; 124]</span>
day," replied Grethel, "what treasure do you bring to-day?"
"I bring nothing. Have you anything to give?" Grethel presented
Hans with a needle. "Good-by," said he. "Good-by,
Hans." Hans took the needle, stuck it in a load of hay, and
walked home behind the wagon.</p>

<p>"Good evening, mother." "Good evening, Hans. Where
have you been?" "To Grethel's." "And what have you
given her?" "Nothing; she has given me something." "What
has Grethel given you?" "A needle," said Hans. "And
where have you put it?" "In the load of hay." "Then you
have behaved stupidly, Hans; you should put needles on
your coat-sleeve." "To behave better, do nothing at all,"
thought Hans.</p>

<p>"Whither are you going, Hans?" "To Grethel's, mother."
"Behave well, Hans." "I will take care; good-by, mother."
"Good-by, Hans."</p>

<p>Hans came to Grethel. "Good day," said he. "Good day,
Hans. What treasure do you bring?" "I bring nothing.
Have you anything to give?" Grethel gave Hans a knife.
"Good-by, Grethel." "Good-by, Hans." Hans took the
knife, put it in his sleeve, and went home.</p>

<p>"Good evening, mother." "Good evening, Hans. Where
have you been?" "To Grethel's." "And what did you take
to her?" "I took nothing; she has given to me." "And what
did she give you?" "A knife," said Hans. "And where have
you put it?" "In my sleeve." "Then you have behaved
foolishly again, Hans; you should put knives in your pocket."
"To behave better, do nothing at all," thought Hans.</p>

<p>"Whither are you going, Hans?" "To Grethel's, mother."
"Behave well, Hans." "I will take care; good-by, mother."
"Good-by, Hans."</p>

<p>Hans came to Grethel. "Good day, Grethel." "Good
day, Hans. What treasure do you bring?" "I bring nothing.
Have you anything to give?" Grethel gave Hans a young goat.
"Good-by, Grethel." "Good-by, Hans." Hans took the
goat, tied its legs, and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>Just as he reached home it was suffocated. "Good evening,
mother." "Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?"
<span class="left"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[page&nbsp; 125]</span>
"To Grethel's." "And what did you take to her?" "I took
nothing; she gave to me." "And what did Grethel give you?"
"A goat." "Where did you put it, Hans?" "In my pocket."
"There you acted stupidly, Hans; you should have tied the goat
with a rope." "To behave better, do nothing," thought
Hans.</p>

<p>"Whither away, Hans?" "To Grethel's, mother." "Behave
well, Hans." "I'll take care; good-by, mother." "Good-by,
Hans."</p>

<p>Hans came to Grethel. "Good day," said he. "Good
day, Hans. What treasure do you bring?" "I bring nothing.
Have you anything to give?" Grethel gave Hans a piece of
bacon. "Good-by, Grethel." "Good-by, Hans." Hans took
the bacon, tied it with a rope, and swung it to and fro so that the
dogs came and ate it up. When he reached home he held the
rope in his hand, but there was nothing on it.</p>

<p>"Good evening, mother," said he. "Good evening, Hans.
Where have you been?" "To Grethel's, mother." "What
did you take there?" "I took nothing; she gave to me."
"And what did Grethel give you?" "A piece of bacon," said
Hans. "And where have you put it?" "I tied it with a rope,
swung it about, and the dogs came and ate it up." "There you
acted stupidly, Hans; you should have carried the bacon on your
head." "To behave better, do nothing," thought Hans.</p>

<p>"Whither away, Hans?" "To Grethel's, mother." "Behave
well, Hans." "I'll take care; good-by, mother." "Good-by,
Hans."</p>

<p>Hans came to Grethel. "Good day," said he. "Good
day, Hans. What treasure do you bring?" "I bring nothing.
Have you anything to give?" Grethel gave Hans a calf.
"Good-by," said Hans. "Good-by." Hans took the calf, set
it on his head, and the calf scratched his face.</p>

<p>"Good evening, mother." "Good evening, Hans. Where
have you been?" "To Grethel's." "What did you take
her?" "I took nothing; she gave to me." "And what did
Grethel give you?" "A calf," said Hans. "And what did you
do with it?" "I set it on my head, and it kicked my face."
"Then you acted stupidly, Hans; you should have led the calf
<span class="left"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[page&nbsp; 126]</span>
home, and put it in the stall." "To behave better, do nothing,"
thought Hans.</p>

<p>"Whither away, Hans?" "To Grethel's, mother." "Behave
well, Hans." "I'll take care; good-by, mother." "Good
by, Hans."</p>

<p>Hans came to Grethel. "Good day," said he. "Good day,
Hans. What treasure do you bring?" "I bring nothing.
Have you anything to give?" Grethel said: "I will go with
you, Hans." Hans tied a rope round Grethel, led her home,
put her in the stall, and made the rope fast; and then he went
to his mother.</p>

<p>"Good evening, mother." "Good evening, Hans. Where
have you been?" "To Grethel's." "What did you take her?"
"I took nothing." "What did Grethel give you?" "She
gave nothing; she came with me." "And where have you left
her, then?" "I tied her with a rope, put her in the stall, and
threw in some grass." "Then you acted stupidly, Hans; you
should have looked at her with friendly eyes." "To behave
better, do nothing," thought Hans; and then he went into the
stall, and made sheep's eyes at Grethel.</p>

<p>And after that Grethel became Hans's wife.</p>

<h2>PUSS IN BOOTS</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> upon a time there was a miller, who was so poor that
at his death he had nothing to leave to his three children
but his mill, his ass, and his cat. The eldest son took the mill,
and the second the ass, so there was nothing left for poor Jack
but to take Puss.</p>

<p>Jack could not help thinking that he had been treated shabbily.
"My brothers will be able to earn an honest livelihood," he
sighed, "but as for me, though Puss may feed himself by catching
mice, I shall certainly die of hunger."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/0565.jpg"><img src="images/0565-306.jpg" width="306" height="450" alt="Do not Grieve, Dear Master." border="0" /></a><br /><br />
<p class="center"><b>Do not Grieve, Dear Master.</b></p>
</div>

<p>The cat, who had overheard his young master, jumped upon
<span class="left"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[page&nbsp; 127]</span>
his shoulder, and, rubbing himself gently against his cheek, began
to speak. "Dear master," said he, "do not grieve. I am
not as useless as you think me, and will undertake to make your
fortune for you, if only you will buy me a pair of boots, and give
me that old bag."</p>

<p>Now, Jack had very little money to spare, but, knowing
Puss to be a faithful old friend, he made up his mind to trust
him, and so spent all he possessed upon a smart pair of boots
made of buff-colored leather. They fitted perfectly, so Puss
put them on, took the old bag which his master gave him, and
trotted off to a neighboring warren in which he knew there was
a great number of rabbits.</p>

<p>Having put some bran and fresh parsley into the bag, he laid
it upon the ground, hid himself, and waited. Presently two
foolish little rabbits, sniffing the food, ran straight into the bag,
when the clever cat drew the strings and caught them.</p>

<p>Then, slinging the bag over his shoulder, he hastened off to
the palace, where he asked to speak to the King. Having been
shown into the royal presence, he bowed and said:</p>

<p>"Sire, my Lord the Marquis of Carabas has commanded me
to present these rabbits to your Majesty, with his respects."</p>

<p>The monarch having desired his thanks to be given to the
Marquis (who, as you will guess, was really our poor Jack), then
ordered his head cook to dress the rabbits for dinner, and he and
his daughter partook of them with great enjoyment.</p>

<p>Day by day Puss brought home stores of good food, so that
he and his master lived in plenty, and besides that, he did not
fail to keep the King and his courtiers well supplied with game.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would lay a brace of partridges at the royal
feet, sometimes a fine large hare, but whatever it was, it always
came with the same message: "From my Lord the Marquis of
Carabas"; so that everyone at Court was talking of this strange
nobleman, whom no one had ever seen, but who sent such
generous presents to his Majesty.</p>

<p>At length Puss decided that it was time for his master to be
introduced at Court. So one day he persuaded him to go and
bathe in a river near, having heard that the King would soon
pass that way.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[page&nbsp; 128]</span>

<p>Jack stood shivering up to his neck in water, wondering what
was to happen next, when suddenly the King's carriage appeared
in sight. At once Puss began to call out as loudly as he could:</p>

<p>"Help, help! My Lord the Marquis of Carabas is drowning!"</p>

<p>The King put his head out of the carriage window and,
recognizing the cat, ordered his attendants to go to the assistance
of the Marquis. While Jack was being taken out of the water,
Puss ran to the King and told him that some robbers had run off
with his master's clothes whilst he was bathing, the truth of the
matter being that the cunning cat had hidden them under a
stone.</p>

<p>On hearing this story the King instantly despatched one of
his grooms to fetch a handsome suit of purple and gold from the
royal wardrobe, and arrayed in this, Jack, who was a fine, handsome
fellow, looked so well that no one for a moment supposed
but that he was some noble foreign lord.</p>

<p>The King and his daughter were so pleased with his appearance
that they invited him into their carriage. At first Jack
hesitated, for he felt a little shy about sitting next to a Princess,
but she smiled at him so sweetly, and was so kind and gentle,
that he soon forgot his fears and fell in love with her there and
then.</p>

<p>As soon as Puss had seen his master seated in the royal
carriage, he whispered directions to the coachman, and then ran
on ahead as fast as he could trot, until he came to a field of corn,
where the reapers were busy.</p>

<p>"Reapers," said he fiercely, "the King will shortly pass this
way. If he should ask you to whom this field belongs, remember
that you say, 'To the Marquis of Carabas.' If you dare to disobey
me, I will have you all chopped up as fine as mincemeat."
The reapers were so afraid the cat would keep his word that they
promised to obey. Puss then ran on and told all the other
laborers whom he met to give the same answer, threatening
them with terrible punishments if they disobeyed.</p>

<p>Now, the King was in a very good humor, for the day was
fine, and he found the Marquis a very pleasant companion, so he
told the coachman to drive slowly, in order that he might admire
<span class="left"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[page&nbsp; 129]</span>
the beautiful country. "What a fine field of wheat!" he said
presently. "To whom does it belong?" Then the men
answered as they had been told: "To our Lord the Marquis of
Carabas." Next they met a herd of cattle, and again to the
King's question, "To whom do they belong?" they were told,
"To the Marquis of Carabas." And it was the same with
everything they passed.</p>

<p>The Marquis listened with the greatest astonishment, and
thought what a very wonderful cat his dear Puss was; and the
King was delighted to find that his new friend was as wealthy as
he was charming.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Puss, who was well in advance of the Royal party,
had arrived at a stately castle, which belonged to a cruel Ogre,
the richest ever known, for all the lands the King had admired
so much belonged to him. Puss knocked at the door and asked
to see the Ogre, who received him quite civilly, for he had never
seen a cat in boots before, and the sight amused him.</p>

<p>So he and Puss were soon chatting away together.</p>

<p>The Ogre, who was very conceited, began to boast of what
clever tricks he could play, and Puss sat and listened, with a
smile on his face.</p>

<p>"I once heard, great Ogre," he said at last, "that you
possessed the power of changing yourself into any kind of animal
you chose&mdash;a lion or an elephant, for instance."</p>

<p>"Well, so I can," replied the Ogre.</p>

<p>"Dear me! how much I should like to see you do it now,"
said Puss sweetly.</p>

<p>The Ogre was only too pleased to find a chance of showing
how very clever he was, so he promised to transform himself into
any animal Puss might mention.</p>

<p>"Oh! I will leave the choice to you," said the cat politely.</p>

<p>Immediately there appeared where the Ogre had been seated,
an enormous lion, roaring, and lashing with its tail, and looking
as though it meant to gobble the cat up in a trice.</p>

<p>Puss was really very much frightened, and, jumping out of
the window, managed to scramble on to the roof, though he
could scarcely hold on to the tiles on account of his high-heeled
boots.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[page&nbsp; 130]</span>

<p>There he sat, refusing to come down, until the Ogre changed
himself into his natural form, and laughingly called to him that
he would not hurt him.</p>

<p>Then Puss ventured back into the room, and began to compliment
the Ogre on his cleverness.</p>

<p>"Of course, it was all very wonderful," he said, "but it
would be more wonderful still if you, who are so great and fierce,
could transform yourself into some timid little creature, such as
a mouse. That, I suppose, would be quite impossible?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said the vain Ogre; "one is quite as easy to me
as the other, as I will show you." And in a moment a little
brown mouse was frisking about all over the floor, whilst the
Ogre had vanished.</p>

<p>"Now or never," said Puss, and with a spring he seized the
mouse and gobbled it up as fast as he could.</p>

<p>At the same moment all the gentlemen and ladies whom the
wicked Ogre had held in his castle under a spell, became disenchanted.
They were so grateful to their deliverer that they
would have done anything to please him, and readily agreed to
enter into the service of the Marquis of Carabas when Puss asked
them to do so.</p>

<p>So now the cat had a splendid castle, which he knew to be
full of heaped-up treasures, at his command, and ordering a
magnificent feast to be prepared, he took up his station at the
castle gates to welcome his master and the royal party.</p>

<p>As soon as the castle appeared in sight, the King enquired
whose it was, "For," said he, "I have never seen a finer."</p>

<p>Then Puss, bowing low, threw open the castle gates, and
cried:</p>

<p>"May it please your Majesty to alight and enter the home of
the most noble the Marquis of Carabas."</p>

<p>Full of surprise, the King turned to the Marquis. "Is this
splendid castle indeed yours?" he asked. "Not even our own
palace is more beautiful, and doubtless it is as splendid within as
without."</p>

<p>Puss then helped his Majesty to alight, and conducted him
into the castle, where a group of noble gentlemen and fair ladies
were waiting to receive them. Jack, or the Marquis as he was
<span class="left"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[page&nbsp; 131]</span>
now called, gave his hand to the young Princess, and led her to
the banquet. Long and merrily they feasted, and when at
length the guests rose to depart, the King embraced the Marquis,
and called him his dear son; and the Princess blushed so charmingly
and looked so shy and sweet, that Jack ventured to lay his
heart and fortune at her feet.</p>

<p>And so the miller's son married the King's daughter, and
there were great rejoicings throughout the land.</p>

<p>On the evening of the wedding-day a great ball was given, to
which princes and noblemen from far and near were invited.
Puss opened the ball, wearing for the occasion a pair of boots
made of the finest leather, with gold tassels and scarlet heels. I
only wish you could have seen him.</p>

<p>When the old King died, the Princess and her husband
reigned in his stead, and their most honored and faithful friend
at Court was Puss himself, for his master never forgot to whom
he owed all his good fortune. He lived upon the daintiest meat
and most delicious cream, and was petted and made much of all
the days of his life, and never again ran after mice and rats, except
for exercise and amusement.</p>

<h2>THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HERE</b> was once a shoemaker who, through no fault of his
own, had become so poor that at last he had only leather
enough left for one pair of shoes. At evening he cut out the
shoes which he intended to begin upon the next morning, and
since he had a good conscience, he lay down quietly, said his
prayers, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>In the morning when he had prayed, as usual, and was preparing
to sit down to work, he found the pair of shoes standing
finished on his table. He was amazed, and could not understand
it in the least.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[page&nbsp; 132]</span>
<p>
He took the shoes in his hand to examine them more closely.
They were so neatly sewn that not a stitch was out of place, and
were as good as the work of a master-hand.</p>

<p>Soon after a purchaser came in, and as he was much pleased
with the shoes, he paid more than the ordinary price for them, so
that the shoemaker was able to buy leather for two pairs with the
money.</p>

<p>He cut them out in the evening, and next day, with fresh
courage was about to go to work; but he had no need to, for when
he got up, the shoes were finished, and buyers were not lacking.
These gave him so much money that he was able to buy leather
for four pairs of shoes.</p>

<p>Early next morning he found the four pairs finished, and so
it went on; what he cut out at evening was finished in the morning,
so that he was soon again in comfortable circumstances, and
became a well-to-do man.</p>

<p>Now it happened one evening, not long before Christmas,
when he had cut out shoes as usual, that he said to his wife:
"How would it be if we were to sit up to-night to see who it is
that lends us such a helping hand?"</p>

<p>The wife agreed, lighted a candle, and they hid themselves
in the corner of the room behind the clothes which were hanging
there.</p>

<p>At midnight came two little naked men, who sat down at the
shoemaker's table, took up the cut-out work, and began with
their tiny fingers to stitch, sew, and hammer so neatly and quickly,
that the shoemaker could not believe his eyes. They did not
stop till everything was quite finished, and stood complete on the
table; then they ran swiftly away.</p>

<p>The next day the wife said: "The little men have made us
rich, and we ought to show our gratitude. They run about with
nothing on, and must freeze with cold. Now I will make them
little shirts, coats, waistcoats, and hose, and will even knit them
stout stockings, and you shall make them each a pair of shoes."</p>

<p>The husband agreed, and at evening, when they had everything
ready, they laid out the presents on the table, and hid themselves
to see how the little men would behave.</p>

<p>At midnight they came skipping in, and were about to set to
<span class="left"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[page&nbsp; 133]</span>
work; but, instead of the leather ready cut out, they found the
charming little clothes.</p>

<p>At first they were surprised, then excessively delighted.
With the greatest speed they put on and smoothed down the
pretty clothes, singing:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Now we're dressed so fine and neat,</p>
<p>Why cobble more for others' feet?"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Then they hopped and danced about, and leaped over chairs
and tables and out at the door. Henceforward, they came back
no more, but the shoemaker fared well as long as he lived, and
had good luck in all his undertakings.</p>

<h2>HANS IN LUCK</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">H</span></p>
<p><b>ANS</b> had served his master seven long years; so he said to
him: "Master, my time is out, and my wish is to return
home to my mother: give me, if you please, my reward."</p>

<p>The master answered: "Thou hast truly and faithfully
served me; as the service was, so shall the reward be." And he
gave Hans a piece of gold as big as his head.</p>

<p>Hans pulled out his handkerchief, wrapped up the lump of
gold in it, and, throwing it over his shoulder, made his way home.
As he went on his way, always putting one foot before the other,
he met a man galloping briskly along on a fine horse.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Hans, quite aloud, "what a capital thing it is to
ride! There you sit as comfortably as in a chair, kicking against
no stones, saving your shoe-leather, and getting to your journey's
end almost without knowing it!"</p>

<p>The horseman, who heard this, pulled up and cried, "Hullo,
Hans why do you trudge on foot?"</p>

<p>"Because I must," answered he; "for I have this big lump to
carry home. It is real gold, you know; but, all the same, I can
scarcely hold up my head, it weighs so terribly on my shoulders."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[page&nbsp; 134]</span>
<p>
"I'll tell you what," said the horseman: "we'll just
exchange. I'll give you my horse and you give me your lump
of gold."</p>

<p>"With all my heart!" said Hans. "But I warn you, you'll
have a job to carry it."</p>

<p>The horseman dismounted, took the gold, and helped Hans
up; and, giving the bridle into his hand, said: "If you want him
to go at full speed, you must cluck with your tongue and cry
'C'ck! c'ck!'"</p>

<p>Hans was heartily delighted, as he sat on his horse and rode
gaily along.</p>

<p>After a while he fancied he would like to go faster, so he began
to cluck with his tongue and cry "C'ck! c'ck!" The horse
broke into a smart trot, and before Hans was aware he was
thrown off&mdash;splash!&mdash;into a ditch which divided the highway
from the fields, and there he lay. The horse, too, would have
run away had it not been stopped by a peasant, as he came along
the road, driving his cow before him.</p>

<p>Hans pulled himself together and got upon his legs again.
He felt very downcast, and said to the peasant: "It's a poor
joke, that riding, especially when one lights upon such a brute as
this, which kicks and throws one off so that one comes near to
breaking one's neck. You don't catch me on his back again.
Now, there's more sense in a cow like yours, behind which you
can walk in peace and quietness, besides having your butter,
milk, and cheese every morning for certain. What would I not
give for such a cow!"</p>

<p>"Well," said the peasant, "if it would give you so much
pleasure, I will exchange my cow for your horse."</p>

<p>Hans gladly consented, and the peasant flung himself on the
horse and rode quickly off.</p>

<p>Hans drove the cow peacefully along, thinking: "What a
lucky fellow I am! I have just to get a bit of bread (and that
isn't a difficult matter) and then, as often as I like, I can eat my
butter and cheese with it. If I am thirsty, I just milk my cow
and drink. What more could I desire?"</p>

<p>When he came to an inn, he made a stop, and in his great joy
ate all the food he had with him right up, both dinner and supper.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[page&nbsp; 135]</span>

<p>With his two last farthings, he bought himself half a glass of beer.
Then he drove his cow towards his mother's village.</p>

<p>As the morning went on, the more oppressive the heat became,
and Hans found himself in a field some three miles long.</p>

<p>Then he felt so hot that his tongue was parched with thirst.
"This is soon cured," thought Hans. "I have only to milk my
cow, drink, and refresh myself."</p>

<p>He tied the cow to a withered tree, and as he had no pitcher
he placed his leathern cap underneath her; but in spite of all his
trouble not a drop of milk could be got.</p>

<p>And he went to work so clumsily that the impatient brute
gave him such a kick with her hind leg that he was knocked over
and quite dazed, and for a long time did not know where he was.</p>

<p>Luckily a butcher came by just then, wheeling a young pig
in a barrow.</p>

<p>"What kind of joke is this?" cried he, helping our friend
Hans to rise.</p>

<p>Hans told him what had happened. The butcher passed
him his bottle and said:</p>

<p>"There, drink and revive yourself. That cow will never
give any milk; she is an old animal and, at the best, is only fit for
the plow or the butcher."</p>

<p>"Oho!" said Hans, running his fingers through his hair.
"Who would have thought it? It is all right indeed when you
can slaughter such a beast in your own house. But I don't
think much of cow's flesh; it is not tender enough. Now, if one
had a young pig! That would taste far different, to say nothing
of the sausages!"</p>

<p>"Listen, Hans," said the butcher. "For your sake, I will
exchange, and let you have my pig for your cow."</p>

<p>"May Heaven reward your friendship!" said Hans, and at
once gave him the cow.</p>

<p>The man untied the pig from the wheelbarrow, and gave the
rope with which it was bound into Hans's hand.</p>

<p>Hans marched on, thinking: "What a lucky fellow I am.
As soon as anything goes wrong, something turns up and all's
right again."</p>

<p>Just then, up came a youth, carrying a fine white goose under
<span class="left"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[page&nbsp; 136]</span>
his arm. They were friends, and Hans began to talk about his
luck and how he always came off best in his exchanges. The
youth told him he was taking the goose to a christening feast.</p>

<p>"Just hold it," he continued, seizing it by the wings, "and
feel how heavy it is: yet it was only fattened for eight weeks.
It will be a rich morsel when roasted."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hans, weighing it with his hand, "it is certainly
heavy, but my pig is by no means to be despised."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the lad was looking thoughtfully around, shaking
his head. "Listen," he said, "I don't think it's all right about
your pig. In the village I have just come through, one has
lately been stolen from the magistrate's own sty. I fear it is the
one you have. They have sent people out, and it would be a
bad business if they found you with the pig. The least they
would do would be to throw you into jail."</p>

<p>Our friend Hans was downcast. "Alas," he cried, "help
me in my need! You know your way here better than I. Take
my pig then, and give me your goose."</p>

<p>"I shall be running great risks," said the youth, "but at
least I will prevent your getting into trouble."</p>

<p>He took the rope in his hand and drove the pig quickly away
down a by-path, and Hans went on relieved of his sorrow,
towards home, with the goose under his arm.</p>

<p>"What a lucky fellow I am!" he said to himself. "First, I
shall have a good roast; then there is the quantity of dripping
that will fall out, which will keep me in bread-and-dripping for
a quarter of a year; and lastly, the splendid white feathers, with
which I will have my pillow stuffed; then I shall fall asleep without
rocking. How glad my mother will be!"</p>

<p>When he was at length come to the village, there stood in the
street a scissors-grinder with his truck. His wheel hummed,
and he sang the while:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"My wheel I turn, and the scissors I grind,</p>
<p>And my cloak hangs flowing free in the wind."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Hans remained standing, and watched him; at length he
spoke to him, and said:</p>

<p>"You must be doing well since you are so merry over your
grinding."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[page&nbsp; 137]</span>
<p>
"Yes," said the scissors-grinder; "the work has gold at the
bottom of it. A proper scissors-grinder is the sort of man who,
whenever he puts his hand in his pocket, finds money there.
But where have you bought that fine goose?"</p>

<p>"I did not buy it, but exchanged it for my pig."</p>

<p>"And the pig?"</p>

<p>"I obtained him for a cow."</p>

<p>"And the cow?"</p>

<p>"I had her for a horse."</p>

<p>"And the horse?"</p>

<p>"For him I gave a lump of gold as big as my head."</p>

<p>"And the gold?"</p>

<p>"Why, that was my reward for seven years of service."</p>

<p>"You have certainly done well for yourself each time," said
the scissors-grinder. "If you could only hear money rattling in
your pocket every time you got up, your fortune would be made."</p>

<p>"How shall I set about it?" said Hans.</p>

<p>"You must become a grinder, like me. All you want is a
grindstone: the rest comes of itself. I have one which is a little
damaged indeed, but for which I would ask nothing more than
your goose; would that suit you?"</p>

<p>"How can you ask me?" answered Hans. "I shall be the
luckiest fellow on earth. If I have money as often as I feel in my
pocket, what else shall I have to care about?" And he handed
over the goose, and took the grindstone in receipt.</p>

<p>"Now," said the grinder, lifting up an ordinary heavy field-stone,
which lay beside him. "There you have a capital stone,
which will be just the thing to hammer your old nails straight
upon. Take it and lift it up carefully."</p>

<p>Hans raised the stone and marched on with a joyful heart,
his eyes shining with pleasure.</p>

<p>"I must have been born lucky," he cried out. "All that I
desire comes to me, as to a Sunday-child."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, having been on his legs since daybreak, he began
to feel tired; besides which, he was tormented by hunger, for he
had eaten up all his provision in his joy over the exchange of the
cow.</p>

<p>At length he could only proceed with great trouble and must
<span class="left"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[page&nbsp; 138]</span>
needs stop every minute; the stones, too, crushed him terribly.
Then he could not conceal the thought: "How nice it would
be now to have nothing to carry!"</p>

<p>Like a snail he crept up to a well, wishing to rest himself and
enjoy a refreshing drink.</p>

<p>In order not to spoil the stones in setting them down, he laid
them carefully on the ground one beside the other, and bent
himself down to drink, but by an accident he gave them a little
push, and both stones went splashing down.</p>

<p>Hans, when he saw them sinking in the depths of the well,
jumped up with joy, kneeled down and thanked God, with tears
in his eyes, that He had shown him this grace and, without
troubling him to think what to do with them, had relieved him
of the heavy stones which would have been such a hindrance to
him.</p>

<p>"There is no man under the sun," he cried out, "so lucky
as I."</p>

<p>With a bright heart and free from all care, he sprang upon
his way, until he was home at his mother's.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b>GIRL</b> once went to the fair to hire herself for a servant. At
last a funny-looking old gentleman engaged her, and took
her home to his house. When she got there, he told her that he
had something to teach her, for that in his house he had his
own names for things.</p>

<p>He said to her: "What will you call me?"</p>

<p>"Master or mister, or whatever you please, sir," says she.</p>

<p>He said: "You must call me 'Master of all Masters.' And
what would you call this?" pointing to his bed.</p>

<p>"Bed or couch, or whatever you please, sir."</p>

<p>"No, that's my 'barnacle.' And what do you call these?"
said he, pointing to his pantaloons.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[page&nbsp; 139]</span>
<p>
"Breeches or trousers, or whatever you please, sir."</p>

<p>"You must call them 'squibs and crackers,' And what
would you call her?" pointing to the cat.</p>

<p>"Cat or kit, or whatever you please, sir."</p>

<p>"You must call her 'white-faced simminy.' And this, now,"
showing the fire, "what would you call this?"</p>

<p>"Fire or flame, or whatever you please, sir."</p>

<p>"You must call it 'hot cockalorum.' And what, this?" he
went on, pointing to the water.</p>

<p>"Water or wet, or whatever you please, sir."</p>

<p>"No, 'pondalorum' is its name. And what do you call all
this?" asked he, as he pointed to the house.</p>

<p>"House or cottage, or whatever you please, sir."</p>

<p>"You must call it 'high topper mountain.'"</p>

<p>That very night the servant woke her master up in a fright
and said: "Master of all Masters, get out of your barnacle and
put on your squibs and crackers. For white-faced simminy has
got a spark of hot cockalorum on its tail, and unless you get some
pondalorum, high topper mountain will be all on hot cockalorum."

<h2>BELLING THE CAT</h2>

<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> upon a time the mice sat in council and talked of how
they might outwit their enemy, the Cat. But good advice
was scarce, and in vain the president called upon all the most
experienced mice present to find a way.</p>

<p>At last a very young mouse held up two fingers and asked to
be allowed to speak, and as soon as he could get permission he
said:</p>

<p>"I've been thinking for a long time why the Cat is such a
dangerous enemy. Now, it's not so much because of her quickness,
though people make so much fuss about that. If we could
only <i>notice</i> her in time, I've no doubt we're nimble enough to
<span class="left"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[page&nbsp; 140]</span>
jump into our holes before she could do us any harm. It's in
her velvet paws, there's where she hides her cruel claws till she
gets us in her clutches&mdash;that's where her power lies. With
those paws she can tread so lightly that we can't hear her coming.
And so, while <i>we</i> are still dancing heedlessly about the place, she
creeps close up, and before we know where we are she pounces
down on us and has us in her clutches. Well, then, it's my
opinion we ought to hang a bell round her neck to warn us of her
coming while there's yet time."</p>

<p>Every one applauded this proposal, and the council decided
that it should be carried out.</p>

<p>Now the question to be settled was, who should undertake to
fasten the bell round the Cat's neck?</p>

<p>The president declared that no one could be better fitted for
the task than he who had given such excellent advice.</p>

<p>But at that the young mouse became quite confused and
stammered an excuse. He was too young for the deed, he said.
He didn't know the Cat well enough. His grandfather, who
knew her better, would be more suited to the job.</p>

<p>But the grandfather declared that just because he knew the
Cat very well he would take good care not to attempt such a task.</p>

<p>And the long and the short of it was that no other mouse
would undertake the duty; and so this clever proposal was never
carried out, and the Cat remained mistress of the situation.</p>

<p><b>N</b> a great wide forest, full of beautiful trees, and green glades,
and thorny thickets, there lived a long time ago a wood-cutter
and his wife, who had only one child, a little girl. She was so
pretty, and so good, that the sun seemed to shine more brightly
when its light fell upon her rosy little face, and the birds would
seem to sing more sweetly when she was passing by.</p>

<p>Her real name was Maisie; but the neighbors round about
<span class="left"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[page&nbsp; 141]</span>
all called her "Little Red Riding-Hood," because of a scarlet
riding-hood and cloak that her kind old grandmother had made
for her, and which she nearly always wore.</p>

<p>She was a happy, merry little child, with a smile and a gentle
word for everybody, and so you may easily believe that everybody
loved her, and was glad to catch a glimpse of her golden
curls and her scarlet cloak as she tripped along, singing, under
the green boughs.</p>

<p>Now, this, let me tell you before I forget, was at the time
when all the birds and beasts, or very nearly all, could speak just
as well as you or I; and nobody was surprised to hear them talk,
as I suppose one would be nowadays.</p>

<p>Well, as I was saying, Little Red Riding-Hood lived with her
parents in a little white cottage with a green door and a thatched
roof, and red and white roses climbing all over the walls, and even
putting their pretty heads in at the latticed windows, to peep at
the child who was so like them.</p>

<p>It was on a bright spring morning early in May, when little
Red Riding-Hood had just finished putting away the breakfast-cups
that her mother came bustling in from the dairy.</p>

<p>"Here's a to-do," she said. "Farmer Hodge has this very
minute told me that he hears your Grannie isn't quite well, and I
can't leave the cheese-making this morning for love or money!
Do you go, my dear, and find out how she is&mdash;and&mdash;stay&mdash;take
her this little pot of sweet fresh butter, and these two new-laid
eggs, and these nice tasty little pasties. Maybe they'll tempt
her to eat a bit. Here's your basket, and don't be too long away,
honey."</p>

<p>So little Red Riding-Hood pulled her hood over her curls, and
set off down the sunny green slope, with her basket in her hand,
at a brisk pace. But as she got deeper into the forest, she
walked more slowly. Everything was so beautiful; the great
trees waved their huge arms over her, the birds were calling to
one another from the thorns all white with blossom, and the child
began singing as she went, she could not have told why, but I
think it was because the beautiful world made her feel glad.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Riding Hood and the Wolf.</b></p>
</div>

<p>The path wound along through the trees, and, as it grew wider
after turning a corner, Red Riding-Hood saw that she was likely
<span class="left"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[page&nbsp; 142]</span>
to have company on her walk; for, where two cross-paths
divided, there sat a big gray wolf licking his long paws, and
looking sharply about him. And "Good morning, Red Riding-Hood,"
said he.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Wolf," she answered.</p>

<p>"And where may you be going, sweet lass?" said the Wolf, as
he walked beside her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Grannie isn't very well, and mother cannot leave the
cheese-making this morning, and so I'm taking her some little
dainties in my basket, and I am to see how she is, and tell mother
when I get back," said the child with a smile.</p>

<p>"And," said the wolf, "where does your good Grannie live,
little lady?"</p>

<p>"Through the copse, and down the hollow, and over the
bridge, and three meadows after the mill."</p>

<p>"Does she indeed?" cried he. "Why, then, I do believe
she is a very dear old friend of mine, whom I have not seen for
years and years. Now, I'll tell you what we'll do, you and I:
I will go by this way, and you shall take that, and whoever
gets there first shall be the winner of the game."</p>

<p>So the Wolf trotted off one way, and Red Riding-Hood went
the other; and I am sorry to say that she lingered and loitered
more than she ought to have done on the road.</p>

<p>Well, what with one thing and another, the sun was right up
in the very mid-most middle of the sky when she crossed the last
meadow from the mill and came in sight of her grandmother's
cottage, and the big lilac-bushes that grew by the garden gate.</p>

<p>"Oh! dear, how I must have lingered!" said the child, when
she saw how high the sun had climbed since she set out on her
journey; and, pattering up the garden-path, she tapped at the
cottage door.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" said a very gruff kind of voice from inside.</p>

<p>"It's only I, Grannie dear, your little Red Riding-Hood
with some goodies for you in my basket, answered the child.</p>

<p>"Then pull the bobbin," cried the voice, "and the latch will
go up."</p>

<p>"What a dreadful cold poor Grannie must have, to be sure,
to make her so hoarse," thought the child. Then she pulled the
<span class="left"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[page&nbsp; 143]</span>
bobbin, and the latch went up, and Red Riding-Hood pushed
open the door, and stepped inside the cottage.</p>

<p>It seemed very dark in there after the bright sunlight outside,
and all Red Riding-Hood could see was that the window-curtains
and the bed-curtains were still drawn, and her grandmother
seemed to be lying in bed with the bed-clothes pulled almost
over her head, and her great white-frilled nightcap nearly hiding
her face.</p>

<p>Now, you and I have guessed by this time, although poor
Red Riding-Hood never even thought of such a thing, that it
was not her Grannie at all, but the wicked Wolf, who had hurried
to the cottage and put on Grannie's nightcap and popped into
her bed, to pretend that he was Grannie herself.</p>

<p>And where was Grannie all this time, you will say? Well,
we shall see presently.</p>

<p>"Come and sit down beside my bed, dearie," wheezed the
Wolf, "and let us have a little chat." Then the Wolf stretched
out his large hairy paws and began to unfasten the basket.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Red Riding-Hood, "what great arms you have,
Grannie!"</p>

<p>"All the better to hug you with," said the Wolf.</p>

<p>"And what great rough ears you have, Grannie!"</p>

<p>"All the better to hear you with, my little dear."</p>

<p>"And your eyes, Grannie; what great yellow eyes you have!"</p>

<p>"All the better to see you with, my pet," grinned the Wolf.</p>

<p>"And oh! oh! Grannie," cried the child, in a sad fright,
"what great sharp teeth you have!"</p>

<p>"All the better to eat you with!" growled the Wolf, springing
up suddenly at Red Riding-Hood. But just at that very
moment the door flew open, and two tall wood-cutters rushed in
with their heavy axes, and killed the wicked Wolf in far less time
than it takes me to tell you about it.</p>

<p>"But where is Grannie?" asked Little Red Riding-Hood,
when she had thanked the brave wood-cutters. "Oh! where
can poor Grannie be? Can the cruel Wolf have eaten her up?"</p>

<p>And she began to cry and sob bitterly&mdash;when, who should
walk in but Grannie herself, as large as life, and as hearty as
ever, with her marketing-basket on her arm! For it was another
<span class="left"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[page&nbsp; 144]</span>
old dame in the village who was not very well, and Grannie
had been down to visit her and give her some of her own famous
herb-tea.</p>

<p>So everything turned out right in the end, and all lived
happily ever after; but I promise you that little Red Riding-Hood
never made friends with a Wolf again!</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b>TRADESMAN</b> had once transacted a good day's business
at a fair, disposed of all his goods, and filled his purse with
gold and silver. He prepared afterward to return, in order to
reach home by the evening, so he strapped his portmanteau, with
the money in it, upon his horse's back, and rode off. At noon
he halted in a small town, and as he was about to set out again,
the stable-boy who brought his horse said to him: "Sir, a nail is
wanting in the shoe on the left hind foot of your animal."</p>

<p>"Let it be wanting," replied the tradesman; "I am in a hurry
and the iron will doubtless hold the six hours I have yet to
travel."</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon he had to dismount again, and feed his
horse, and at this place also the boy came and told him that a
nail was wanting in one of the shoes, and asked him whether he
should take the horse to a farrier. "No, no, let it be!" replied
the master; "it will last out the couple of hours that I have now to
travel; I am in haste." So saying he rode off; but his horse
soon began to limp, and from limping it came to stumbling, and
presently the beast fell down and broke its leg. Thereupon the
tradesman had to leave his unfortunate horse lying on the road,
to unbuckle the portmanteau, and to walk home with it upon
his shoulder, where he arrived at last late at night.</p>

<p>"And all this misfortune," said he to himself, "is owing to
the want of a nail. More haste, the less speed!"</p>

<h2>JACK AND THE BEANSTALK</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> upon a time there lived a poor widow who had an only
son named Jack. She was very poor, for times had been
hard, and Jack was too young to work. Almost all the furniture
of the little cottage had been sold to buy bread, until at last there
was nothing left worth selling. Only the good cow, Milky
White, remained, and she gave milk every morning, which they
took to market and sold. But one sad day Milky White gave no
milk, and then things looked bad indeed.</p>

<p>"Never mind, mother," said Jack. "We must sell Milky
White. Trust me to make a good bargain," and away he went
to the market.</p>

<p>For some time he went along very sadly, but after a little he
quite recovered his spirits. "I may as well ride as walk," said
he; so instead of leading the cow by the halter, he jumped on her
back, and so he went whistling along until he met a butcher.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said the butcher.</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir," answered Jack.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" said the butcher.</p>

<p>"I am going to market to sell the cow."</p>

<p>"It's lucky I met you," said the butcher. "You may save
yourself the trouble of going so far."</p>

<p>With this, he put his hand in his pocket, and pulled out five
curious-looking beans. "What do you call these?" he said.</p>

<p>"Beans," said Jack.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "beans, but they're the most wonderful
beans that ever were known. If you plant them overnight, by
the next morning they'll grow up and reach the sky. But to
save you the trouble of going all the way to market, I don't mind
exchanging them for that cow of yours."</p>

<p>"Done!" cried Jack, who was so delighted with the bargain
that he ran all the way home to tell his mother how lucky he had
been.</p>

<p>But oh! how disappointed the poor widow was.</p>

<p>"Off to bed with you!" she cried; and she was so angry that
she threw the beans out of the window into the garden. So poor
<span class="left"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[page&nbsp; 146]</span>
Jack went to bed without any supper, and cried himself to sleep.</p>

<p>When he woke up the next morning, the room was almost
dark; and Jack jumped out of bed and ran to the window to see
what was the matter. The sun was shining brightly outside, but
from the ground right up beside his window there was growing a
great beanstalk, which stretched up and up as far as he could see,
into the sky.</p>

<p>"I'll just see where it leads to," thought Jack, and with that
he stepped out of the window on to the beanstalk, and began to
climb upwards. He climbed up and up, till after a time his
mother's cottage looked a mere speck below, but at last the stalk
ended, and he found himself in a new and beautiful country. A
little way off there was a great castle, with a broad road leading
straight up to the front gate. But what most surprised Jack
was to find a beautiful maiden suddenly standing beside him.</p>

<p>"Good morning, ma'am," said he, very politely.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Jack," said she; and Jack was more surprised
than ever, for he could not imagine how she had learned
his name. But he soon found that she knew a great deal more
about him than his name; for she told him how, when he was
quite a little baby, his father, a gallant knight, had been slain by
the giant who lived in yonder castle, and how his mother, in order
to save Jack, had been obliged to promise never to tell the secret.</p>

<p>"All that the giant has is yours," she said, and then disappeared
quite as suddenly as she came.</p>

<p>"She must be a fairy," thought Jack.</p>

<p>As he drew near to the castle, he saw the giant's wife standing
at the door.</p>

<p>"If you please, ma'am," said he, "would you kindly give me
some breakfast? I have had nothing to eat since yesterday."</p>

<p>Now, the giant's wife, although very big and very ugly, had a
kind heart, so she said: "Very well, little man, come in; but you
must be quick about it, for if my husband, the giant, finds you
here, he will eat you up, bones and all."</p>

<p>So in Jack went, and the giant's wife gave him a good breakfast,
but before he had half finished it there came a terrible knock
at the front door, which seemed to shake even the thick walls of
the castle.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[page&nbsp; 147]</span>

<p>"Dearie me, that is my husband!" said the giantess, in a
terrible fright; "we must hide you somehow," and she lifted
Jack up and popped him into the empty kettle.</p>

<p>No sooner had the giant's wife opened the door than her
husband roared out:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Fee, fi, fo, fum,</p>
<p>I smell the blood of an Englishman;</p>
<p>Be he alive, or be he dead,</p>
<p>I'll grind his bones to make my bread!"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>"It's a boy, I'm sure it is," he continued. "Where is he? I'll
have him for my breakfast."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said his wife; "you must be mistaken. It's
the ox's hide you smell." So he sat down, and ate up the greater
part of the ox. When he had finished he said: "Wife, bring me
my money-bags." So his wife brought him two full bags of
gold, and the giant began to count his money. But he was so
sleepy that his head soon began to nod, and then he began to
snore, like the rumbling of thunder. Then Jack crept out,
snatched up the two bags, and though the giant's dog barked
loudly, he made his way down the beanstalk back to the cottage
before the giant awoke.</p>

<p>Jack and his mother were now quite rich; but it occurred to
him one day that he would like to see how matters were going on
at the giant's castle. So while his mother was away at market,
he climbed up, and up, and up, and up, until he got to the top
of the beanstalk again.</p>

<p>The giantess was standing at the door, just as before, but
she did not know Jack, who, of course, was more finely dressed
than on his first visit. "If you please, ma'am," said he, "will
you give me some breakfast?"</p>

<p>"Run away," said she, "or my husband the giant will eat
you up, bones and all. The last boy who came here stole two
bags of gold&mdash;off with you!" But the giantess had a kind heart,
and after a time she allowed Jack to come into the kitchen, where
she set before him enough breakfast to last him a week. Scarcely
had he begun to eat than there was a great rumbling like an
earthquake, and the giantess had only time to bundle Jack into
the oven when in came the giant. No sooner was he inside the
room than he roared:</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[page&nbsp; 148]</span>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Fee, fi, fo, fum,</p>
<p>I smell the blood of an Englishman;</p>
<p>Be he alive, or be he dead,</p>
<p>I'll grind his bones to make my bread!"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>But his wife told him he was mistaken, and after breakfasting
off a roasted bullock, just as if it were a lark, he called out:
"Wife, bring the little brown hen!" The giantess went out and
brought in a little brown hen, which she placed on the table.</p>

<p>"Lay!" said the giant; and the hen at once laid a golden egg.
"Lay!" said the giant a second time; and she laid another
golden egg. "Lay!" said the giant a third time; and she laid a
third golden egg.</p>

<p>"That will do for to-day," said he, and stretched himself out
to go to sleep. As soon as he began to snore, Jack crept out of
the oven, went on tiptoe to the table, and, snatching up the little
brown hen, made a dash for the door. Then the hen began to
cackle, and the giant began to wake up; but before he was quite
awake, Jack had escaped from the castle, and, climbing as fast
as he could down the beanstalk, got safe home to his mother's
cottage.</p>

<p>The little brown hen laid so many golden eggs that Jack and
his mother had now more money than they could spend. But
Jack was always thinking about the beanstalk; and one day he
crept out of the window again, and climbed up, and up, and up,
and up, until he reached the top.</p>

<p>This time, you may be sure, he was careful not to be seen; so
he crept round to the back of the castle, and when the giant's
wife went out he slipped into the kitchen and hid himself in the
oven. In came the giant, roaring louder than ever:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Fee, fi, fo, fum,</p>
<p>I smell the blood of an Englishman;</p>
<p>Be he alive; or be he dead,</p>
<p>I'll grind his bones to make my bread!"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>But the giantess was quite sure that she had seen no little
boys that morning; and after grumbling a great deal, the giant
sat down to breakfast. Even then he was not quite satisfied,
for every now and again he would say:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Fee, fi, fo, fum,</p>
<p>I smell the blood of an Englishman;"</p>
  </div>  </div>
<span class="left"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[page&nbsp; 149]</span>
<p>and once he got up and looked in the kettle. But, of course,
Jack was in the oven all the time!</p>

<p>When the giant had finished, he called out: "Wife, bring me
the golden harp!" So she brought in the golden harp, and
placed it on the table. "Sing!" said the giant; and the harp at
once began to sing the most beautiful songs that ever were heard.
It sang so sweetly that the giant soon fell fast asleep; and then
Jack crept quietly out of the oven, and going on tiptoe to the
table, seized hold of the golden harp. But the harp at once
called out: "Master! master!" and the giant woke up just in
time to catch sight of Jack running out of the kitchen-door.</p>

<p>With a fearful roar, he seized his oak-tree club, and dashed
after Jack, who held the harp tight, and ran faster than he had
ever run before. The giant, brandishing his club, and taking
terribly long strides, gained on Jack at every instant, and he
would have been caught if the giant hadn't slipped over a boulder.
Before he could pick himself up, Jack began to climb down the
beanstalk, and when the giant arrived at the edge he was nearly
half-way to the cottage. The giant began to climb down too;
but as soon as Jack saw him coming, he called out: "Mother,
bring me an axe!" and the widow hurried out with a chopper.
Jack had no sooner reached the ground than he cut the beanstalk
right in two. Down came the giant with a terrible crash,
and that, you may be sure, was the end of him. What became
of the giantess and the castle nobody knows. But Jack and
his mother grew very rich, and lived happy ever after.</p>

<h2>HOW TO TELL A TRUE PRINCESS</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HERE</b> was once upon a time a Prince who wanted to marry
a Princess, but she must be a true Princess. So he traveled
through the whole world to find one, but there was always something
against each. There were plenty of Princesses, but he
could not find out if they were true Princesses. In every case
there was some little defect, which showed the genuine article
<span class="left"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[page&nbsp; 150]</span>
was not yet found. So he came home again in very low spirits,
for he had wanted very much to have a true Princess. One
night there was a dreadful storm; it thundered and lightened and
the rain streamed down in torrents. It was fearful! There
was a knocking heard at the palace gate, and the old King went
to open it.</p>

<p>There stood a Princess outside the gate; but oh, in what a sad
plight she was from the rain and the storm! The water was
running down from her hair and her dress into the points of her
shoes and out at the heels again. And yet she said she was a
true Princess!</p>

<p>"Well, we shall soon find out!" thought the old Queen.
But she said nothing and went into the sleeping-room, took off
all the bedclothes, and laid a pea on the bottom of the bed.
Then she put twenty mattresses on top of the pea and twenty
eider-down quilts on the top of the mattresses. And this was
the bed in which the princess was to sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning she was asked how she had slept.</p>

<p>"Oh, very badly!" said the Princess. "I scarcely closed my
eyes all night! I am sure I don't know what was in the bed. I
lay on something so hard that my whole body is black and blue.
It is dreadful!"</p>

<p>Now they perceived that she was a true Princess, because she
had felt the pea through the twenty mattresses and the twenty
eider-down quilts.</p>

<p>No one but a true Princess could be so sensitive.</p>

<p>So the Prince married her, for now he knew that at last he
had got hold of a true Princess. And the pea was put into the
Royal Museum, where it is still to be seen if no one has stolen it.
Now, this is a true story.</p>

</div>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> upon a time long ago&mdash;so long, indeed, that even the
very oldest people now alive could not remember it&mdash;there
lived a King and Queen in a beautiful palace, a great white
<span class="left"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[page&nbsp; 151]</span>
marble palace, with wide halls and high towers, and a golden
roof that flashed in the sun.</p>

<p>And all round the palace, for miles and miles, there were
lovely gardens and pleasure-grounds, with terraces and green
lawns, and ancient trees where the birds would sit and sing all
day and all night long, and more flowers than you could ever
think of if you were to think a whole summer through. There
were peacocks and birds of paradise on the broad lawns, and
pretty slender brown deer in the shady glades, and gold and silver
fishes in the ponds and fountains, and great red and yellow
fruits ripened in the orchards.</p>

<p>There was everything there that heart could wish&mdash;except
just one, and that was the one thing in all the world that this
King and Queen wanted to make them perfectly happy. For
there was no little child to run and play about the sunny gardens
and pick the flowers, and pet the birds and beasts that wandered
there. And this would often make them very sad.</p>

<p>But at last, after many years, they had their wish, and a little
baby daughter was born to them&mdash;a tiny child with a face like a
blush rosebud, eyes like violets, and a little red mouth like the
pimpernel flowers that grow in the cornfields and by the wayside
in summer-time.</p>

<p>Now, you can easily think how glad this King and Queen
were, and what great rejoicings were made over all the country.</p>

<p>Bonfires as big as haystacks were kept burning all night, fat
oxen were roasted whole in the market-place of every town, the
church-bells were rung and rung again until the ringers were out
of breath and their arms were aching, and every little child in the
kingdom was given a beautiful present for the baby Princess's
sake.</p>

<p>In the palace, of course, all was bustle and hurry to make
ready for the christening-feast; the maids were busy putting
flowers all about the halls and chambers, and sprinkling the
shining floors with sweet-smelling leaves and petals.</p>

<p>For the most important guests invited to this christening
were seven very powerful fairies, and you know, I am sure, how
particular fairies are about what they eat and drink. Not that
they are greedy; but they are used to such delicate food that even
<span class="left"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[page&nbsp; 152]</span>
the very best of ours seems strange to them. So the Queen was
very anxious that they should be pleased; for they had been
asked to be godmothers to the baby Princess, and she wanted
them to be in a good humor so that they should be kind to her
little one.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful summer afternoon, and the roses on the
palace terrace were nodding their heads sleepily in the warm
breeze, when the fairies' chariots came into sight, sailing through
the blue sky like a flight of bright-winged butterflies.</p>

<p>They were all good fairies, and had known the King and
Queen all their lives long, and as they had not seen them for
some time there was a great deal to talk about and much news
to tell. And, dear me! how pleased they were with the baby!
They all agreed that she was the prettiest little darling they had
ever seen&mdash;almost as pretty as a real fairy baby&mdash;and <i>that</i> was
a compliment indeed, I can tell you.</p>

<p>And when they went in to the great banqueting-hall and sat
down to table, they were even more delighted than at first. For
each one of them there was a set of six golden dinner things&mdash;knife, spoon,
fork, cup, dish, and plate&mdash;made on purpose as a
present for each, and all different. One was set with pearls, another
with diamonds, the third with rubies, the fourth with opals,
the fifth with amethysts, the sixth with emeralds, the seventh
with sapphires; and nobody could tell which was the most beautiful.</p>

<p>They were just going to begin, and everybody was as happy
as happy could be, when, all of a sudden, there was a clashing of
brazen claws and a rushing of wings, and something like a black
cloud seemed to pass before the tall windows and darken all the
room, so that the guests could hardly see their plates. Then
the great doors burst open with a terrible bang, and an old fairy
in a long trailing black gown, with her face almost hidden in a
black hood, jumped out of a black chariot drawn by fierce
griffins, and stalked up to the table.</p>

<p>The King turned pale, and the Queen nearly fainted away,
for this was the spiteful fairy Tormentilla, who lived all alone, an
immense distance away from everywhere and everyone, in a
dismal black stone castle in the middle of a desert. The poor
<span class="left"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[page&nbsp; 153]</span>
Queen had been so happy and so busy that she had forgotten all
about her, and never sent her an invitation.</p>

<p>However, they all tried to make the best of it, and another
chair was brought, and another place laid for Tormentilla; and
both the King and Queen told her over and over again how very,
very sorry they were not to have asked her.</p>

<p>It was all in vain. Nothing could please her; she would eat
and drink nothing, and she sat, scowling and looking angrily at
the other fairies' jeweled cups and dishes, until the feast was
over, and it was time to give the presents.</p>

<p>Then they all went into the great tapestried room where the
tiny Princess lay sleeping in her mother-o'-pearl cradle, and the
seven fairies began to say what they would each give her.</p>

<p>The first stepped forward and said: "She shall always be as
good as gold"; the second: "She shall be the cleverest Princess
in the world"; the third: "She shall be the most beautiful"; the
fourth: "She shall be the happiest"; the fifth: "She shall have
the sweetest voice that was ever heard"; the sixth: "Everyone
shall love her." And then the wicked old cross fairy strode over
to the cradle with long quick steps, and said, shaking her black
crooked stick at the King and Queen: "<i>And I say that she shall
prick her hand with a spindle and die of the wound</i>!"</p>

<p>At this the Queen fell on her knees and begged and prayed
Tormentilla to call back her cruel words; but suddenly the
seventh fairy, the youngest of all, who knew Tormentilla well,
and had hidden herself behind the curtains for fear that some
such thing might happen, came out and said:</p>

<p>"Do not cry so, dear Queen; I cannot quite undo my cousin's
wicked enchantment, but I can promise you that your
daughter shall not die, but only fall asleep for a hundred years.
And, when these are past and gone, a Prince shall come and
awaken her with a kiss."</p>

<p>So the King and Queen dried their tears and thanked the
kind fairy Heartsease for her goodness; and all the fairies went
back to their homes, and things went on much as usual in the
palace. But you can imagine how careful the Queen was of her
little girl; and the King made a law that every spindle in the
country must be destroyed, and that no more should be made,
<span class="left"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[page&nbsp; 154]</span>
and that anyone who had a spindle should be heavily punished
if not executed at once.</p>

<p>Well, the years went by happily enough until the Princess
Miranda was almost eighteen years old, and all that the six
fairies had promised came true, for she was the best and the
prettiest and the cleverest Princess in all the world, and everybody
loved her. And, indeed, by this time Tormentilla's spiteful
words were almost forgotten.</p>

<p>"Poor old thing," the Queen would sometimes say, "she
was so angry at having been left out that she did not know what
she was saying. Of course, she did not really mean it."</p>

<p>Now, the King and Queen had to go away for a few days to a
great entertainment that one of their richest nobles was giving
at his country house; and, as the Princess did not wish to go,
they left her behind with her ladies-in-waiting in the beautiful
old palace. For the first two days she amused herself very well,
but on the third she missed her father and mother so much that,
to pass the time till they came back, she began exploring all the
old lumber-rooms and out-of-the-way attics in the palace, and
laughing at the dusty furniture and queer curiosities she found
there.</p>

<p>At last she found herself at the top of a narrow winding stairway
in a tall turret that seemed even older than all the rest of the
palace. And when she lifted the latch of the door in front of her
she saw a little low chamber with curiously painted walls, and
there sat a little old, old woman in a high white cap, spinning
at a wheel.</p>

<p>For some time she stood at the door, watching the old woman
curiously; she could not imagine what she was doing, for the
Princess had never seen a spinning-wheel in her life before, because,
as I told you, the King had ordered them all to be destroyed.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that the poor old woman who lived in this
tower had never heard the King's command, for she was so deaf
that if you shouted until you were hoarse she would never have
been able to understand you.</p>

<p>"What pretty work you are doing there, Goody? And why
does that wheel go whirr, whirr, whirr?" said the Princess.
<span class="left"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[page&nbsp; 155]</span>
The old woman neither answered nor looked up, for, of course,
she did not hear.</p>

<p>So the Princess stepped into the room and laid her hand upon
the old woman's shoulder.</p>

<p>Goody started then, looked up, and rubbed her eyes.</p>

<p>"Deary, deary me!" cried she, in a high, cracked voice.
"And who may you be, my pretty darling?"</p>

<p>"I'm the Princess Miranda," screamed the maiden in her
ear, but the old woman only shook her head&mdash;she could hear
nothing.</p>

<p>Then the Princess pointed to the spindle, and made the old
woman understand that she wanted to try if she could work it.</p>

<p>So Goody nodded, and laughed, and got up from her seat,
and the Princess sat down and took the spindle in her hand.
But no sooner did she touch it than she pricked the palm of her
hand with the point, and sank down in a swoon.</p>

<p>Immediately a deep silence fell on all around. The little
bird that only a moment before had been singing so sweetly upon
the window-sill hushed his song. The distant hum of voices
from the courtyard beneath ceased; even Goody stopped short
in the directions she was giving the Princess, and neither moved
hand nor foot towards the poor little maid, and all because she
had fallen fast asleep as she stood.</p>

<p>Below in the castle it was just the same. The King and
Queen, who had that moment returned from their journey and
were enquiring for their daughter, fell asleep before the
lady-in-waiting
could answer them, and as to the lady herself she had begun
to snore&mdash;in a ladylike manner, of course&mdash;before you could
have winked your eye.</p>

<p>The soldiers and men-at-arms slumbered as they stood.
The page-boy fell asleep writh his mouth wide open, and a fly
that had just been going to settle on his nose fell asleep too in
mid-air.</p>

<p>Although the sun had been shining brightly when the Princess
took the spindle in her hand, no sooner did she prick herself
with the point than deep shadows darkened the sunny rooms and
gardens.</p>

<p>It was just as though night had overtaken them, but there
<span class="left"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[page&nbsp; 156]</span>
was no one in or near the palace to heed whether it were dark or
light.</p>

<p>This sudden darkness had been caused by a magic wood
which had sprung up all around the palace and its grounds. It
was at least half a mile thick, and was composed of thorns and
prickly plants, through which it seemed impossible for anyone
to penetrate. It was so thick and high that it hid even the topmost
towers of the enchanted castle, and no one outside could
have dreamed that such a castle lay behind it.</p>

<p>Well, and so the years went on, and on, and on, until a hundred
years had passed, and the palace and the story of it were all
but forgotten. And it happened that a King's son from a
neighboring country came hunting that way with his men, and
horses, and dogs. And in the excitement of the chase he rode
on and on until he became separated from his servants and attendants,
and found himself in a part of the country where he
had never been before. In vain he tried to retrace his steps;
he only seemed to wander farther away in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>Presently he came to a woodcutter's cottage, and dismounted
to ask his way. An old, old man lived in this hut, and after he
had directed the Prince as to the best way back, the young man
pointed to a thick wood ahead, and asked what lay beyond it.
Then the old man told him that there was a legend that beyond
the wood was an enchanted palace where a beautiful Princess
had lain sleeping for a hundred years, and whom a Prince was
to awaken with a kiss.</p>

<p>Directly the Prince Florimond heard this, nothing would
serve but he must go there and see for himself if the tale were
true. So he rode and he rode until he came to the edge of the
wood, and there he got off his horse and began to push his way
through the thorny thicket. It was hard work indeed, for the
briars were so strong and so sharp that you would never believe
that anyone could get past them, and they closed up behind him
as he went.</p>

<p>But he was strong and brave, and after a time the way became
easier, until at last he came to the palace.</p>

<p>There everyone was sleeping&mdash;the sentinels and soldiers in
the court-yard, the cooks in the kitchen, and pages and lords
<span class="left"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[page&nbsp; 157]</span>
and ladies-in-waiting in the corridors and chambers; and, in the
great throne-room the King and Queen on their golden and
ivory thrones.</p>

<p>Prince Florimond passed on, wondering more and more, till
he came at length to the narrow staircase which led to the little
tower in which the Princess had fallen asleep. He mounted
this, and then came the greatest wonder of all&mdash;the beautiful
sleeping lady, in her glistening white robes. She was so beautiful
that to see her almost took away his breath; and, falling on
his knees, he bent to kiss her cheek. And as he kissed her, she
opened her lovely blue eyes and said, smiling: "Oh! Prince,
have you come at last? I have had such pleasant dreams."</p>

<p>Then she sat up laughing and rubbing her eyes, and gave
him her hand, and they went hand in hand together down the
stairs and along the corridors, till they came to the throne-room.
And there were the King and Queen rubbing their eyes too, and
they kissed their daughter and welcomed the Prince most gladly.</p>

<p>And, all at the same time, the whole palace was awake.
Cocks crowed, dogs barked, the cats began to mew, the spits to
turn, the clocks to strike, the soldiers presented arms, the heralds
blew their trumpets, the head cook boxed a little scullion's ears,
the butler went on drinking his half-finished tankard of wine,
the first lady-in-waiting finished winding her skein of silk.</p>

<p>Everything, in short, went on exactly as though the spell had
lasted a hundred seconds instead of years. To be sure, Princess
Miranda's pretty white dress was just such a one as Prince
Florimond's great-grandmother might have worn. But that
gave them something to laugh at.</p>

<p>And now my story is done, for I need hardly tell you that the
Prince and Princess were married amid great rejoicings, and
lived happily ever after; and that the seven fairy godmothers
danced at the wedding. So all ended well, and what more
could anyone wish?</p>

<h3>THE DEAD DOLL</h3>
 <div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>You needn't be trying to comfort me&mdash;I tell you my dolly is dead!</p>
<p>There's no use in saying she isn't, with a crack like that in her head.</p>
<p>It's just like you said it wouldn't hurt much to have my tooth out, that day;</p>
<p>And then, when the man 'most pulled my head off, you hadn't a word to say.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">

<p>Why, glue's for chairs and tables, and toys and the backs of books!</p>

<p>My dolly! my own little daughter! Oh, but it's the awfullest crack!</p>

<p>Now, Nursey, what makes you remind me? I know that I did it myself!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">

<h3>A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS</h3>

<div class="poem1">  <div class="stanza">
<p>'T was the night before Christmas, when all through the house</p>
<p>Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;</p>
<p>The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,</p>
<p>In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;</p>
<p>The children were nestled all snug in their beds,</p>
<p>While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[page&nbsp;174]</span>
<p>And mamma in her kerchief, and I in my cap,</p>
<p>Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,&mdash;</p>
<p>When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,</p>
<p>I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.</p>
<p>Away to the window I flew like a flash,</p>
<p>Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.</p>
<p>The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow</p>
<p>Gave a lustre of midday to objects below;</p>
<p>When what to my wondering eyes should appear,</p>
<p>But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer,</p>
<p>With a little old driver, so lively and quick</p>
<p>I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.</p>
<p>More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,</p>
<p>And he whistled and shouted, and called them by name;</p>
<p>"Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!</p>
<p>On, Comet! on, Cupid, on, Donder and Blitzen!</p>
<p>To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall!</p>
<p>Now dash away, dash away, dash away all!"</p>
<p>As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,</p>
<p>When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,</p>
<p>So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,</p>
<p>With the sleigh full of toys,&mdash;and St. Nicholas too.</p>
<p>And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof</p>
<p>The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.</p>
<p>As I drew in my head, and was turning around,</p>
<p>Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.</p>
<p>He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot,</p>
<p>And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;</p>
<p>A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,</p>
<p>And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.</p>
<p>His eyes how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!</p>
<p>His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry;</p>
<p>His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,</p>
<p>And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.</p>
<p>The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,</p>
<p>And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.</p>
<p>He had a broad face and a little round belly</p>
<p>That shook, when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[page&nbsp;175]</span>
<p>He was chubby and plump&mdash;a right jolly old elf;</p>
<p>And I laughed, when I saw him, in spite of myself.</p>
<p>A wink of his eye and a twist of his head</p>
<p>Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.</p>
<p>He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,</p>
<p>And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,</p>
<p>And laying his finger aside of his nose,</p>
<p>And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.</p>
<p>He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,</p>
<p>And away they all flew like the down of a thistle;</p>
<p>But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,</p>
<p>"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!"</p>

<h3>THE CHATTERBOX</h3>

<div class="poem1">  <div class="stanza">
<p>From morning to night 't was Lucy's delight</p>
<p class="i2">To chatter and talk without stopping;</p>
<p>There was not a day but she rattled away,</p>
<p class="i2">Like water forever a-dropping!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>As soon as she rose, while she put on her clothes,</p>
<p class="i2">'Twas vain to endeavor to still her;</p>
<p>Nor once did she lack to continue her clack,</p>
<p class="i2">Till again she lay down on her pillow.</p>
</div>

  <div class="stanza">
<p>You'll think now, perhaps, there would have been gaps,</p>
<p class="i2">If she hadn't been wonderful clever;</p>
<p>That her sense was so great, and so witty her pate</p>
<p class="i2">That it would be forthcoming forever.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>But that's quite absurd; for have you not heard,</p>
<p class="i2">Much tongue and few brains are connected,</p>
<p>That they are supposed to think least who talk most,</p>
<p class="i2">And their wisdom is always suspected?</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>While Lucy was young, had she bridled her tongue</p>
<p class="i2">With a little good sense and exertion,</p>
<p>Who knows but she might have been our delight,</p>
<p class="i2">Instead of our jest and aversion?</p>

<h3>THE VOICE OF SPRING</h3>

<div class="poem1">  <div class="stanza">
<p>I come, I come! ye have called me long;</p>
<p>I come o'er the mountains, with light and song.</p>
<p>Ye may trace my step o'er the waking earth</p>

<p>I have breathed on the South, and the chestnut-flowers</p>

<p>The fisher is out on the sunny sea,</p>
<p>And the reindeer bounds o'er the pastures free,</p>
<p>And the pine has a fringe of softer green,</p>
<p>And the moss looks bright, where my step has been.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I have sent through the wood-paths a glowing sigh,</p>
<p>And called out each voice of the deep blue sky,</p>
<p>From the night-bird's lay through the starry time,</p>
<p>In the groves of the soft Hesperian clime,</p>
<p>To the swan's wild note by the Iceland lakes,</p>
<p>When the dark fir-branch into verdure breaks.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>From the streams and founts I have loosed the chain;</p>
<p>They are sweeping on to the silvery main.</p>
<p>They are flashing down from the mountain brows,</p>
<p>They are flinging spray o'er the forest boughs,</p>
<p>They are bursting fresh from their sparry caves,</p>
<p>And the earth resounds with the joy of waves.</p>

<h3>SONG OF LIFE</h3>

<div class="poem3">  <div class="stanza">
<p>A traveller on a dusty road</p>
<p class="i2">Strewed acorns on the lea;</p>

<p>Love sought its shade at evening-time,</p>
<p class="i2">To breathe its early vows;</p>
<p>And Age was pleased, in heights of noon,</p>
<p class="i2">To bask beneath its boughs.</p>
<p>The dormouse loved its dangling twigs,</p>

<p>He walled it in, and hung with care</p>
<p class="i2">A ladle on the brink;</p>

<p class="i2">But judged that Toil might drink.</p>
<p>He passed again; and lo! the well,</p>
<p class="i2">By summer never dried,</p>
<p>Had cooled ten thousand parch&eacute;d tongues,</p>
<p class="i2">And saved a life beside.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>A nameless man, amid the crowd</p>
<p class="i2">That thronged the daily mart,</p>
<p>Let fall a word of hope and love,</p>
<p class="i2">Unstudied from the heart,</p>
<p>A whisper on the tumult thrown,</p>
<p class="i2">A transitory breath,</p>
<p>It raised a brother from the dust,</p>
<p class="i2">It saved a soul from death.</p>
<p>O germ! O fount! O word of love!</p>
<p class="i2">O thought at random cast!</p>

<h3>THE WIND IN A FROLIC</h3>

<div class="poem1">  <div class="stanza">
<p>The wind one morning sprang up from sleep,</p>
<p>Saying, "Now for a frolic! now for a leap!</p>
<p>Now for a madcap galloping chase!</p>
<p>I'll make a commotion in every place!"</p>
<p>So it swept with a bustle right through a great town,</p>
<p>Creaking the signs, and scattering down</p>
<p>Shutters, and whisking, with merciless squalls,</p>
<p>Old women's bonnets and gingerbread stalls.</p>
<p>There never was heard a much lustier shout,</p>
<p>As the apples and oranges tumbled about;</p>
<p>And the urchins, that stand with their thievish eyes</p>
<p>Forever on watch, ran off each with a prize.</p>
<p class="i2">Then away to the fields it went blustering and humming,</p>
<p>And the cattle all wondered whatever was coming.</p>
<p>It plucked by their tails the grave, matronly cows,</p>
<p>And tossed the colts' manes all about their brows,</p>
<p>Till, offended at such a familiar salute,</p>
<p>They all turned their backs and stood silently mute.</p>
<p>So on it went, capering and playing its pranks;</p>
<p>Whistling with reeds on the broad river banks;</p>
<p>Puffing the birds, as they sat on the spray,</p>
<p>Or the traveler grave on the King's highway.</p>
<p>It was not too nice to bustle the bags</p>
<p>Of the beggar, and flutter his dirty rags,</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[page&nbsp;189]</span>
<p>'T was so bold that it feared not to play its joke</p>
<p>With the doctor's wig, and the gentleman's cloak.</p>
<p>Through the forest it roared, and cried gayly, "Now,</p>
<p>You sturdy old oaks, I'll make you bow!"</p>
<p>And it made them bow without more ado,</p>
<p>Or it cracked their great branches through and through.</p>
<p class="i2">Then it rushed like a monster o'er cottage and farm,</p>
<p>Striking their inmates with sudden alarm;</p>
<p>And they ran out like bees in a midsummer swarm.</p>
<p>There were dames with their kerchiefs tied over their caps,</p>
<p>To see if their poultry were free from mishaps;</p>
<p>The turkeys, they gobbled, the geese screamed aloud,</p>
<p>And the hens crept to roost in a terrified crowd;</p>
<p>There was rearing of ladders, and logs laying on,</p>
<p>Where the thatch from the roof threatened soon to be gone.</p>
<p class="i2">But the wind had passed on, and had met in a lane</p>
<p>With a schoolboy, who panted and struggled in vain,</p>
<p>For it tossed him, and twirled him, then passed, and he stood</p>
<p>With his hat in a pool, and his shoe in the mud.</p>

<p>Many good little girls can rehearse:</p>

<p class="i4">Pretty nearly as well,</p>
<p>If we try the same fable in verse.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">In a dairy a crow,</p>
<p class="i4">Having ventured to go,</p>
<p>Some food for her young ones to seek,</p>
<p class="i4">Flew up in the trees,</p>
<p class="i4">With a fine piece of cheese,</p>
<p>Which she joyfully held in her beak.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">A fox, who lived by,</p>

<p>"The wind, I believe, ma'am, is south:</p>

<p>One honest John Tomkins, a hedger and ditcher,</p>

<p>If John was afflicted with sickness or pain,</p>
<p>He wished himself better, but did not complain,</p>
<p>Nor lie down and fret in despondence and sorrow,</p>

  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>If any one wronged him or treated him ill,</p>

<h3>THE BATTLE OF BLENHEIM</h3>

<div class="poem3">  <div class="stanza">
<p>It was a summer evening,</p>
<p class="i2">Old Kaspar's work was done,</p>
<p>And he before his cottage door</p>
<p class="i2">Was sitting in the sun,</p>
<p>And by him sported on the green</p>
<p>His little grandchild Wilhelmine.</p>

<p>Old Kaspar took it from the boy,</p>

  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"I find them in the garden,</p>

<h3>THE CHAMELEON</h3>

<h5>A FABLE</h5>

<h5>FROM M. DE LAMOTTE</h5>

<div class="poem3">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Oft has it been my lot to mark</p>
<p>A proud, conceited, talking spark,</p>
<p>With eyes, that hardly served at most</p>
<p>To guard their master 'gainst a post;</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[page&nbsp;203]</span>
<p>Yet round the world the blade has been</p>
<p>To see whatever could be seen,</p>
<p>Returning from his finished tour,</p>
<p>Grown ten times perter than before;</p>
<p>Whatever word you chance to drop,</p>
<p>The traveled fool your mouth will stop:</p>
<p>"Sir, if my judgment you'll allow,</p>
<p>I've seen&mdash;and sure I ought to know,"</p>
<p>So begs you'd pay a due submission,</p>
<p>And acquiesce in his decision.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Two travelers of such a cast,</p>
<p>As o'er Arabia's wilds they passed</p>
<p>And on their way in friendly chat,</p>
<p>Now talked of this, and then of that,</p>
<p>Discoursed awhile, 'mongst other matter.</p>
<p>Of the chameleon's form and nature.</p>
<p>"A stranger animal," cries one,</p>
<p>"Sure never lived beneath the sun.</p>
<p>A lizard's body, lean and long,</p>
<p>A fish's head, a serpent's tongue,</p>
<p>Its foot with triple claw disjoined;</p>
<p>And what a length of tail behind!</p>
<p>How slow its pace; and then its hue&mdash;</p>
<p>Who ever saw so fine a blue?"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"Hold, there," the other quick replies,</p>
<p>"'T is <i>green</i>, I saw it with these eyes,</p>
<p>As late with open mouth it lay,</p>
<p>And warmed it in the sunny ray:</p>
<p>Stretched at its ease, the beast I viewed</p>
<p>And saw it eat the air for food."</p>
<p class="i2">"I've seen it, sir, as well as you,</p>
<p>And must again affirm it blue;</p>
<p>At leisure I the beast surveyed,</p>
<p>Extending in the cooling shade."</p>

<p class="i2">So high at last the contest rose,</p>

<p>When luckily came by a third&mdash;</p>
<p>To him the question they referred,</p>
<p>And begged he'd tell 'em, if he knew,</p>
<p>Whether the thing was green or blue.</p>
<p class="i2">"Sirs," cries the umpire, "cease your pother!</p>
<p>The creature's neither one nor t' other.</p>
<p>I caught the animal last night,</p>
<p>And viewed it o'er by candlelight:</p>
<p>I marked it well&mdash;'t was black as jet&mdash;</p>
<p>You stare&mdash;but sirs, I've got it yet,</p>

<p>The reptile, you'll pronounce him green."</p>
<p class="i2">"Well, then, at once to ease the doubt,"</p>
<p>Replies the man, "I'll turn him out:</p>
<p>And when before your eyes I've set him,</p>
<p>If you don't find him black, I'll eat him."</p>
<p class="i2">He said: then full before their sight</p>
<p>Produced the beast, and lo!&mdash;'t was white.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Both stared, the man looked wondrous wise&mdash;</p>
<p>"My children," the chameleon cries,</p>
<p>(Then first the creature found a tongue,)</p>
<p>"You are all right, and all are wrong:</p>
<p>When next you talk of what you view,</p>

<p>Nor wonder, if you find that none</p>

  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"Thou art a handy maiden,"</p>

<p><b>HERE</b> was a man who once had a very handsome goose,
that always laid golden eggs. Now, he thought there must
be gold inside of her, so he wrung her neck straightway, and
found she was exactly like all other geese. He thought to find
riches, and lost the little he had.</p>

<p>The fable teaches that one who has anything should be content
with it, and avoid covetousness, lest he lose what he has.</p>

<h2>THE BOYS AND THE FROGS</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>A company of idle boys were watching some frogs by the
side of a pond, and as fast as any of the frogs lifted their heads
the boys would pelt them down again with stones.</p>

<p>"Boys," said one of the frogs, "you forget that, though this
may be fun for you, it is death to us."</p>

<h2>THE LION AND THE MOUSE</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>A mouse happened to run into the mouth of a sleeping lion,
who roused himself, caught him, and was just about eating him,
when the little fellow begged him to let him go, saying, "If I am
saved, I shall be everlastingly grateful." So, with a smile, the
lion let him off. It befell him not long after to be saved by the
mouse's gratitude, for when he was caught by some hunters and
bound by ropes to a tree, the mouse, hearing his roaring groans,
<span class="left"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[page&nbsp;221]</span>
came and gnawed the ropes, and set him free, saying, "You
laughed at me once, as if you could receive no return from me,
but now, you see, it is you who have to be grateful to me."</p>

<p>The story shows that there come sudden changes of affairs,
when the most powerful owe everything to the weakest.</p>

<h2>THE FOX AND THE GRAPES</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>A hungry fox discovered some bunches of grapes hanging
from a vine high up a tree, and, as he gazed, longed to get at
them, and could not; so he left them hanging there and went off
muttering, "They're sour grapes."</p>

<h2>THE FROG AND THE OX</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>An ox, grazing in a swampy meadow, chanced to set his foot
among a parcel of young frogs, and crushed nearly the whole
brood to death. One that escaped ran off to his mother with the3
dreadful news. "O mother," said he, "it was a beast&mdash;such a
big four-footed beast, that did it!" "Big?" quoth the old frog,
"How big? was it as big"&mdash;and she puffed herself out&mdash;"as
big as this?" "Oh, a great deal bigger than that." "Well,
was it so big?" and she swelled herself out yet more. "Indeed,
mother, but it was; and if you were to burst yourself, you would
never reach half its size." The old frog made one more trial,
determined to be as big as the ox, and burst herself, indeed.</p>

<h2>THE CAT, THE MONKEY, AND THE CHESTNUTS</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>A cat and a monkey were sitting one day in the chimney
corner watching some chestnuts which their master had laid
down to roast in the ashes. The chestnuts had begun to burst
with the heat, and the monkey said to the cat, "It is plain that
<span class="left"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[page&nbsp;222]</span>
your paws were made especially for pulling out those chestnuts.
Do you reach forth and draw them out. Your paws are, indeed,
exactly like our master's hands." The cat was greatly flattered
by this speech, and reached forward for the tempting chestnuts,
but scarcely had he touched the hot ashes than he drew back
with a cry, for he had burnt his paw; but he tried again, and
managed to pull one chestnut out; then he pulled another, and a
third, though each time he singed the hair on his paws. When
he could pull no more out he turned about and found that the
monkey had taken the time to crack the chestnuts and eat them.</p>

<h2>THE COUNTRY MAID AND HER MILKPAIL</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>A country maid was walking slowly along with a pail of milk
upon her head, and thinking thus:</p>

<p>"The money for which I shall sell this milk will buy me three
hundred eggs. These eggs, allowing for what may prove addled,
will produce at least two hundred and fifty chickens. The
chickens will be fit to carry to market about Christmas, when
poultry always brings a good price, so that by May-day I shall
have money enough to buy a new gown. Let me see&mdash;green
suits me; yes, it shall be green. In this dress I will go to the fair,
where all the young fellows will want me for a partner, but I
shall refuse every one of them." By this time she was so full of
her fancy that she tossed her head proudly, when over went the
pail, which she had entirely forgotten, and all the milk was spilled
on the ground.</p>

<p>Moral. Don't count your chickens before they are hatched.</p>

<h2>THE ASS IN THE LION'S SKIN</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ass once dressed himself in the Lion's skin and went
about frightening all the little beasts. Now he happened on the
Fox, and tried to frighten him too; but the Fox chanced to hear
<span class="left"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[page&nbsp;223]</span>
him speak, and said: "Well, to be sure, I should have been
frightened too, if I hadn't heard you bray, and seen your ears
sticking out."</p>

<p>So there are some men who make themselves appear very
fine outwardly, but are betrayed as soon as they begin to talk.</p>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What a dull, heavy creature," says the Hare, "is this Tortoise!"
"And yet," says the Tortoise, "I'll run with you for a
wager." "Done," says the Hare, and then they asked the Fox
to be the judge. They started together, and the Tortoise kept
jogging on still, till he came to the end of the course. The Hare
laid himself down midway and took a nap; "for," says he, "I
can catch up with the Tortoise when I please." But it seems he
overslept himself, for when he came to wake, though he scudded
away as fast as possible, the Tortoise had got to the post before
him and won the wager.</p>

<p>Slow and steady wins the race.</p>

<h2>THE VAIN JACKDAW</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>A
jackdaw picked up some beautiful feathers left by the
peacocks on the ground. He stuck them into his own tail, and,
thinking himself too fine to mix with the other daws, strutted off
to the peacocks, expecting to be welcomed as one of themselves.</p>

<p>The peacocks at once saw through his disguise, and, despising
him for his foolishness and conceit, began to peck him,
and soon he was stripped of all his borrowed plumes.</p>

<p>Very much ashamed, the jackdaw went sadly home, meaning
to join his old friends as if nothing had happened. But they,
remembering how he had scorned them before, chased him away
and would have nothing to do with him.</p>

<p>"If you had been content," said one, "to remain as nature
<span class="left"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[page&nbsp;224]</span>
made you, instead of trying to be what you are not, you would

<h2>THE FOX WITHOUT A TAIL</h2>

<p class="center"><b>The Fox without a Tail.</b></p>
</div>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>A fox lost his tail in escaping from a steel trap. When he
began to go about again, he found that every one looked down
upon or laughed at him. Not liking this, he thought to himself
that if he could persuade the other foxes to cut off their tails,
his own loss would not be so noticeable.</p>

<p>Accordingly he called together the foxes and said: "How is
it that you still wear your tails? Of what use are they? They
are in the way, they often get caught in traps, they are heavy to
carry and not pretty to look upon. Believe me, we are far better
without them. Cut off your tails, my friends, and you will see
how much more comfortable it is. I for my part have never
enjoyed myself so much nor found life so pleasant as I have
since I lost mine."</p>

<p>Upon this, a sly old fox, seeing through the trick, cried, "It
seems to me, my friend, that you would not be so anxious for us
to cut off our tails, if you had not already lost yours."</p>

<h2>THE WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>A wolf put on the skin of a sheep, and getting in among the
flock by means of this disguise, killed many of the sheep. The
shepherd, who wondered why so many of his flock had disappeared,
at last discovered the deceit. He fastened a rope cunningly
round the pretended sheep's neck, led him to a tree, and
there hanged him.</p>

<p>Some other shepherds passing that way and seeing what they
thought was a sheep hanging from a tree, said, "What, brother!
Surely you do not hang sheep?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the shepherd, "but I hang wolves when I
catch them dressed up in sheep's skins!"</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[page&nbsp;225]</span>

<p>Then he showed them their mistake, and they praised the
justice of the deed he had done.</p>

<h2>THE CROW AND THE PITCHER</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>A crow, whose throat was parched and dry with thirst, saw a
pitcher in the distance. In great joy he flew to it, but found that
it held only a little water, and even that was too near the bottom
to be reached, for all his stooping and straining. Next he tried
to overturn the pitcher, thinking that he would at least be able
to catch some of the water as it trickled out. But this he was
not strong enough to do. In the end he found some pebbles
lying near, and by dropping them one by one into the pitcher, he
managed at last to raise the water up to the very brim, and thus
was able to quench his thirst.</p>

<h2>THE MAN, HIS SON, AND HIS ASS</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>A man and his son were leading their ass to market. A girl,
seeing them, cried, "Why walk when you can ride?" On
hearing this, the man set his son upon the ass.</p>

<p>Going further, they heard an old man say, "Shame for the
young to ride while old people walk!" Thereupon the man
made his son get down and rode himself.</p>

<p>Presently they met some women who cried, "Look at the
poor tired son and lazy father!" Hearing this, the man took
his son up beside him and so they rode into the town.</p>

<p>There a young man called to them, "Two men on one beast!
It seems to me you are more fit to carry the ass than he is to carry
you."</p>

<p>Then they got down, tied the beast's legs to a pole, and
carried him thus till they came to a bridge. As they went, the
children shouted so loudly that the ass took fright&mdash;kicked his
legs free, and jumped over the bridge into the river.</p>

<p>Thus having lost his ass, the man went home, crying, "Try
to please everybody and you will please nobody, not even yourself!"</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b>CAMEL</b> said, "Nothing like being tall! See how tall I am."
A pig who heard these words said, "Nothing like being
short; see how short I am!"</p>

<p>The camel said, "Well, if I fail to prove the truth of what I
said, I will give you my hump."</p>

<p>The pig said, "If I fail to prove the truth of what I have
said, I will give up my snout."</p>

<p>"Agreed!" said the camel.</p>

<p>"Just so!" said the pig.</p>

<p>They came to a garden inclosed by a low wall without any
opening. The camel stood on this side the wall, and, reaching
the plants within by means of his long neck, made a breakfast
on them. Then he turned jeeringly to the pig, who had been
standing at the bottom of the wall, without even having a look at
the good things in the garden, and said, "Now, would you be
tall or short?"</p>

<p>Next they came to a garden inclosed by a high wall, with a
wicket gate at one end. The pig entered by the gate, and, after
having eaten his fill of the vegetables within, came out, laughing
at the poor camel, who had had to stay outside, because he was
too tall to enter the garden by the gate, and said, "Now, would
you be tall or short?"</p>

<p>Then they thought the matter over, and came to the conclusion
that the camel should keep his hump and the pig his
snout, observing:</p>

<h2>THE MAN AND HIS PIECE OF CLOTH</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>A man in the East, where they do not require as much
clothing as in colder climates, gave up all worldly concerns and
retired to a wood, where he built a hut and lived in it.</p>

<p>His only clothing was a piece of cloth which he wore round
his waist. But, as ill-luck would have it, rats were plentiful in
the wood, so he had to keep a cat. The cat required milk to
keep it, so a cow had to be kept. The cow required tending, so
a cow-boy was employed. The boy required a house to live in,
so a house was built for him. To look after the house a maid
had to be engaged. To provide company for the maid a few
more houses had to be built, and people invited to live in them.
In this manner a little township sprang up.</p>

<p>The man said, "<i>The further we seek to go from the world and
its cares, the more they multiply</i>!"</p>

<h2>THE SEA, THE FOX, AND THE WOLF</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>A fox that lived by the seashore once met a wolf that had
never seen the sea. The wolf said, "What is the sea?"</p>

<p>"It is a great piece of water by my dwelling," said the fox.</p>

<p>"Is it under your control?" asked the wolf.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the fox.</p>

<p>"Will you show me the sea, then?" said the wolf.</p>

<p>"With pleasure," said the fox. So the fox led the wolf to
the sea, and said to the waves, "Now go back,"&mdash;they went back.
"Now come up,"&mdash;and they came up! Then the fox said to the
waves, "My friend, the wolf, has come to see you, so you will
come up and go back till I bid you stop;" and the wolf saw,
with wonder, the waves coming up and going back.</p>

<p>He said to the fox, "May I go into the sea?"</p>

<p>"As far as you like. Don't be afraid, for, at a word, the sea
would go or come as I bid, and as you have already seen."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[page&nbsp;228]</span>

<p>The wolf believed the fox, and followed the waves rather
far from the shore. A great wave soon upset him, and threw up
his carcass on the shore. The fox made a hearty breakfast on
it, saying, "<i>The fool's ear was made for the knave's tongue</i>."</p>

<h2>THE BIRDS AND THE LIME</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>A fowler in the East once went to a wood, scattered some
grain on the ground, spread a net over it with some lime in it,
and was watching from a distance to see what luck would attend
his efforts.</p>

<p>A great many birds assembled on the trees around the net,
and said, "What fine corn that is! We can seldom hope to get
anything like it."</p>

<p>An owl that was close by said, "How nice that white thing in
the net is!"</p>

<p>"What is it?" said the birds.</p>

<p>"Why, it is our best friend in the world; it is lime. When
it holds us in its embrace, we can never hope to get away."</p>

<p>The birds left the place at once. Said the fowler, "<i>A clever
bird knows the lime!</i>"</p>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>One evening, as some cattle were wending their way home,
a raven rode on the horns of a bull in the herd; and as he approached
the cottage, cried to the farmer, "Friend, my work for
the day is over; you may now take charge of your cattle."</p>

<p>"What was your work?" asked the farmer.</p>

<p>"Why," said the raven, "the arduous task of watching these
cattle and bringing them home."</p>

<p>"Am I to understand you have been doing all the work for
me?" said the farmer.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the raven, and flew away with a laugh.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[page&nbsp;229]</span>

Quoth the farmer with surprise, "<i>How many there are that

<h2>TINSEL AND LIGHTNING</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>A piece of tinsel on a rock once said to a pebble, "You see
how bright I am! I am by birth related to the lightning."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said the pebble; "then accept my humble respects."</p>

<p>Some time after, a flash of lightning struck the rock, and the
tinsel lost all its brilliancy by the scorching effects of the flash.</p>

<p>"Where is your brilliancy now?" said the pebble.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is gone to the skies," said the tinsel, "for I have lent
it to the lightning that came down a moment ago to borrow it
of me."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said the pebble; "<i>how many fibs doth good
bragging need!</i>"</p>

<h2>THE ASS AND THE WATCH-DOG</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>A watch-dog in a village was barking all night to keep thieves
off from his master's house. An ass, who observed this, thought
that the dog amused himself by barking. So he brayed all
night. When the day dawned, the owner of the ass thought the
poor animal had been suffering from some disorder. Therefore
he sent for the village doctor, and laid the case before him.</p>

<p>The doctor examined the animal closely, and said, "Friend,
you must brand this ass forthwith, else he will soon go into fits
and die."</p>

<p>The ass said, "I assure you nothing is wrong with me; I
simply amused myself last night."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the inexorable leech; "I know what the wily
brute means. He would rather die, and make you the loser,
than be branded and recover his health."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[page&nbsp;230]</span>
<p>
So they bound the ass with ropes, and branded him all over
with red-hot irons. Some time after the ass moved out to see
how the village had fared during his illness. The dog asked
why he had been branded. The ass narrated the story. Quoth
the dog, "<i>He that mistakes work for amusement must pay for his
error.</i>"</p>

<p>A child went up to a lark, and said, "Good lark, have you any
young ones?"</p>

<p>"Yes, child, I have," said the lark; "and they are very pretty
ones indeed!" Then she pointed to them, and said, "This is
Fair Wing, that is Tiny Bill, and that other is Bright Eye."</p>

<p>The child said, "Yes, at home, we are three&mdash;myself and my
two sisters, Jane and Alice; and mamma says we are pretty little
children, and that she is very fond of us."</p>

<p>To this the little larks replied, "Oh yes, mamma is very
fond of us too."</p>

<p>Then the child said, "Good lark, will you send home Tiny
Bill to play with me?" Before the lark could reply, Bright
Eye said, "Yes, if you will send little Alice to play with us in our
nest."</p>

<p>The child said, "Oh, Alice will be so sorry to leave home,
and come away from mamma!"</p>

<p>Bright. Eye said, "Tiny Bill will be so sorry to leave our nest,
and go away from mamma!"</p>

<p>The child was abashed, and went home, saying, "<i>Ah, every
one is fond of home</i>!"</p>

<h2>THE HARDY TIN SOLDIER</h2>

<h4>BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HERE</b> were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers; they were all
brothers, for they had all been born of one old tin spoon.
They shouldered their muskets, and looked straight before them;
their uniform was red and blue, and very splendid. The first
thing they had heard in the world, when the lid was taken off
their box, had been the words "Tin soldiers!" These words
were uttered by a little boy, clapping his hands: the soldiers had
been given to him, for it was his birthday; and now he put them
upon the table. Each soldier was exactly like the rest; but one
of them had been cast last of all, and there had not been enough
tin to finish him; but he stood as firmly upon his one leg as the
others on their two; and it was just this Soldier who became remarkable.</p>

<p>On the table on which they had been placed stood many
other playthings, but the toy that attracted most attention was a
neat castle of cardboard. Through the little windows one could
see straight into the hall. Before the castle some little trees
were placed round a little looking-glass, which was to represent
a clear lake. Waxen swans swam on this lake, and were
mirrored in it. This was all very pretty; but the prettiest of all
was a little lady, who stood at the open door of the castle; she
was also cut out in paper, but she had a dress of the clearest
gauze, and a little narrow blue ribbon over her shoulders, that
looked like a scarf; and in the middle of this ribbon was a shining
<span class="left"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[page&nbsp;233]</span>
tinsel rose as big as her whole face. The little lady stretched
out both her arms, for she was a dancer; and then she lifted one
leg so high that the Tin Soldier could not see it at all, and thought
that, like himself, she had but one leg.</p>

<p>"That would be the wife for me," thought he; "but she is
very grand. She lives in a castle, and I have only a box, and
there are five-and-twenty of us in that. It is no place for her.
But I must try to make acquaintance with her."</p>

<p>And then he lay down at full length behind a snuff-box
which was on the table; there he could easily watch the little
dainty lady, who continued to stand upon one leg without losing
her balance.</p>

<p>When the evening came all the other tin soldiers were put
into their box, and the people in the house went to bed. Now
the toys began to play at "visiting," and at "war," and "giving
balls." The tin soldiers rattled in their box, for they wanted to
join, but could not lift the lid. The nutcracker threw somersaults,
and the pencil amused itself on the table: there was so
much noise that the canary woke up, and began to speak too,
and even in verse. The only two who did not stir from their
places were the Tin Soldier and the Dancing Lady: she stood
straight up on the point of one of her toes, and stretched out
both her arms; and he was just as enduring on his one leg; and
he never turned his eyes away from her.</p>

<p>Now the clock struck twelve&mdash;and, bounce! the lid flew off
the snuff-box; but there was no snuff in it, but a little black
Goblin: you see, it was a trick.</p>

<p>"Tin Soldier!" said the Goblin, "don't stare at things that
don't concern you."</p>

<p>But the Tin Soldier pretended not to hear him.</p>

<p>"Just you wait till to-morrow!" said the Goblin.</p>

<p>But when the morning came, and the children got up, the
Tin Soldier was placed in the window; and whether it was the
Goblin or the draught that did it, all at once the window flew
open, and the Soldier fell head over heels out of the third story.
That was a terrible passage! He put his leg straight up, and
stuck with helmet downward and his bayonet between the
paving-stones.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[page&nbsp;234]</span>
<p>
The servant-maid and the little boy came down directly to
look for him, but though they almost trod upon him, they could
not see him. If the Soldier had cried out "Here I am!" they
would have found him; but he did not think it fitting to call out
loudly, because he was in uniform.</p>

<p>Now it began to rain; the drops soon fell thicker, and at last
it came down into a complete stream. When the rain was
past, two street boys came by.</p>

<p>"Just look!" said one of them: "there lies a Tin Soldier.
He must come out and ride in the boat."</p>

<p>And they made a boat out of a newspaper, and put the Tin
Soldier in the middle of it, and so he sailed down the gutter,
and the two boys ran beside him and clapped their hands. Goodness
preserve us! how the waves rose in that gutter, and how
fast the stream ran! But then it had been a heavy rain. The
paper boat rocked up and down, and sometimes turned round so
rapidly that the Tin Soldier trembled; but he remained firm, and
never changed countenance, and looked straight before him, and
shouldered his musket.</p>

<p>All at once the boat went into a long drain, and it became as
dark as if he had been in his box.</p>

<p>"Where am I going now?" he thought. "Yes, yes, that's
the Goblin's fault. Ah! if the little lady only sat here with me
in the boat, it might be twice as dark for what I should care."</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a great Water Rat, which lived under
the drain.</p>

<p>"Have you a passport?" said the Rat. "Give me your
passport."</p>

<p>But the Tin Soldier kept silence, and held his musket tighter
than ever. The boat went on, but the Rat came after it. Hu!
how he gnashed his teeth, and called out to the bits of straw and
wood.</p>

<p>"Hold him! hold him! He hasn't paid toll&mdash;he hasn't
shown his passport!"</p>

<p>But the stream became stronger and stronger. The Tin
Soldier could see the bright daylight where the arch ended; but
he heard a roaring noise, which might well frighten a bolder
man. Only think&mdash;just where the tunnel ended, the drain ran
<span class="left"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[page&nbsp;235]</span>
into a great canal; and for him that would have been as dangerous
as for us to be carried down a great waterfall.</p>

<p>Now he was already so near it that he could not stop. The
boat was carried out, the poor Tin Soldier stiffening himself as
much as he could, and no one could say that he moved an eyelid.
The boat whirled round three or four times, and was full of water
to the very edge&mdash;it must sink. The Tin Soldier stood up to his
neck in water, and the boat sank deeper and deeper, and the
paper was loosened more and more; and now the water closed
over the soldier's head. Then he thought of the pretty little
Dancer, and how he should never see her again; and it sounded
in the Soldier's ears:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Farewell, farewell, thou warrior brave,</p>
<p>For this day thou must die!"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>And now the paper parted, and the Tin Soldier fell out; but
at that moment he was snapped up by a great fish.</p>

<p>Oh, how dark it was in that fish's body! It was darker yet
than in the drain tunnel; and then it was very narrow too. But
the Tin Soldier remained unmoved, and lay at full length shouldering
his musket.</p>

<p class="center"><b>A Voice Said Aloud, "The Tin Soldier!"</b></p>
</div>

<p>The fish swam to and fro; he made the most wonderful movements,
and then became quite still. At last something flashed
through him like lightning. The daylight shone quite clear, and
a voice said aloud, "The Tin Soldier!" The fish had been
caught, carried to market, bought, and taken into the kitchen,
where the cook cut him open with a large knife. She seized the
Soldier round the body with both her hands and carried him into
the room, where all were anxious to see the remarkable man who
had traveled about in the inside of a fish; but the Tin Soldier
was not at all proud. They placed him on the table, and there&mdash;no!
What curious things may happen in the world. The
Tin Soldier was in the very room in which he had been before!
he saw the same children, and the same toys stood on the table;
and there was the pretty castle with the graceful little Dancer.
She was still balancing herself on one leg, and held the other
extended in the air. She was hardy too. That moved the Tin
Soldier; he was very nearly weeping tin tears, but that would not
<span class="left"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[page&nbsp;236]</span>
have been proper. He looked at her, but they said nothing to
each other.</p>

<p>Then one of the little boys took the Tin Soldier and flung
him into the stove. He gave no reason for doing this. It must
have been the fault of the Goblin in the snuff-box.</p>

<p>The Tin Soldier stood there quite illuminated, and felt a
heat that was terrible; but whether this heat proceeded from the
real fire or from love he did not know. The colors had quite
gone off from him; but whether that had happened on the journey,
or had been caused by grief, no one could say. He looked
at the little lady, she looked at him, and he felt that he was melting;
but he still stood firm, shouldering his musket. Then
suddenly the door flew open, and the draught of air caught the
Dancer, and she flew like a sylph just into the stove to the Tin
Soldier, and flashed up in a flame, and she was gone. Then the
Tin Soldier melted down into a lump; and when the servant-maid
took the ashes out next day, she found him in the shape of
a little tin heart. But of the Dancer nothing remained but the
tinsel rose, and that was burned as black as a coal.</p>

<h2>THE FIR TREE</h2>

<h4>BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>UT</b> in the forest stood a pretty little Fir Tree. It had a good
place; it could have sunlight, air there was in plenty, and all
around grew many larger comrades&mdash;pines as well as firs. But
the little Fir Tree wished ardently to become greater. It did
not care for the warm sun and the fresh air; it took no notice of
the peasant children, who went about talking together, when
they had come out to look for strawberries and raspberries.
Often they came with a whole pot-full, or had strung berries on a
straw; then they would sit down by the little Fir Tree and say,
"How pretty and small that one is!" and the Fir Tree did not
like to hear that at all.</p>

<p>Next year he had grown a great joint, and the following year
<span class="left"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[page&nbsp;237]</span>
he was longer still, for in fir trees one can always tell by the number
of rings they have how many years they have been growing.</p>

<p>"Oh, if I were only as great a tree as the other!" sighed the
little Fir, "then I would spread my branches far around, and
look out from my crown into the wide world. The birds would
then build nests in my boughs, and when the wind blew I could
nod just as grandly as the others yonder."</p>

<p>It took no pleasure in the sunshine, in the birds, and in the
red clouds that went sailing over him morning and evening.</p>

<p>When it was winter, and the snow lay all around, white and
sparkling, a hare would often come jumping along, and spring
right over the little Fir Tree. Oh! this made him so angry.
But two winters went by, and when the third came the little
Tree had grown so tall that the hare was obliged to run round it.</p>

<p>"Oh! to grow, to grow, and become old; that's the only fine
thing in the world," thought the Tree.</p>

<p>In the autumn woodcutters always came and felled a few of
the largest trees; that was done this year too, and the little Fir
Tree, that was now quite well grown, shuddered with fear, for
the great stately trees fell to the ground with a crash, and their
branches were cut off, so that the trees looked quite naked, long,
and slender&mdash;they could hardly be recognized. But then they
were laid upon wagons, and horses dragged them away out of
the wood. Where were they going? What destiny awaited
them?</p>

<p>In the spring, when the Swallows and the Stork came, the
Tree asked them, "Do you know where they were taken? Did
you not meet them?"</p>

<p>The Swallows knew nothing about it, but the Stork looked
thoughtful, nodded his head, and said:</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so. I met many new ships when I flew out of
Egypt; on the ships were stately masts; I fancy these were the
trees. They smelt like fir. I can assure you they're stately&mdash;
very stately."</p>

<p>"Oh that I were only big enough to go over the sea! What
kind of thing is this sea, and how does it look?"</p>

<p>"It would take too long to explain all that," said the Stork,
and he went away.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[page&nbsp;238]</span>
<p>
"Rejoice in thy youth," said the Sunbeams; "rejoice in thy
fresh growth, and in the young life that is within thee."</p>

<p>And the Wind kissed the Tree, and the Dew wept tears upon
it; but the Fir Tree did not understand that.</p>

<p>When Christmas-time approached, quite young trees were
felled, sometimes trees which were neither so old nor so large as
this Fir Tree, that never rested, but always wanted to go away.
These young trees, which were always the most beautiful, kept
all their branches; they were put upon wagons, and horses
dragged them away out of the wood.</p>

<p>"Where are they all going?" asked the Fir Tree. "They
are not greater than I&mdash;indeed, one of them was much smaller.
Why do they keep all their branches? Whither are they taken?"</p>

<p>"We know that! We know that!" chirped the Sparrows.
"Yonder in the town we looked in at the windows. We know
where they go. Oh! they are dressed up in the greatest pomp
and splendor that can be imagined. We have looked in at the
windows, and have perceived that they are planted in the middle
of a warm room, and adorned with the most beautiful things&mdash;gilt
apples, honey-cakes, playthings, and many hundred of candles."</p>

<p>"And then?" asked the Fir Tree, and trembled through all
its branches. "And then? What happens then?"</p>

<p>"Why, we have not seen anything more. But it was incomparable."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I may be destined to tread this glorious path one
day!" cried the Fir Tree, rejoicingly. "That is even better
than traveling across the sea. How painfully I long for it! If
it were only Christmas now! Now I am great and grown up,
like the rest who were led away last year. Oh, if I were only
on the carriage! If I were only in the warm room, among all
the pomp and splendor! And then? Yes, then something
even better will come, something far more charming, or else why
should they adorn me so? There must be something grander,
something greater still to come; but what? Oh! I'm suffering,
I'm longing! I don't know myself what is the matter with me!"</p>

<p>"Rejoice in us," said Air and Sunshine. "Rejoice in thy
fresh youth here in the woodland."</p>

<p>But the Fir Tree did not rejoice at all, but it grew and grew;
<span class="left"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[page&nbsp;239]</span>
winter and summer it stood there, green, dark green. The
people who saw it said, "That's a handsome tree!" and at
Christmas time it was felled before any one of the others. The
axe cut deep into its marrow, and the tree fell to the ground with
a sigh; it felt a pain, a sensation of faintness, and could not think
at all of happiness, for it was sad at parting from its home, from
the place where it had grown up; it knew that it should never
again see the dear old companions, the little bushes and flowers
all around&mdash;perhaps not even the birds. The parting was not
at all agreeable.</p>

<p>The Tree only came to itself when it was unloaded in a yard,
with other trees, and heard a man say:</p>

<p>"This one is famous; we only want this one!"</p>

<p>Now two servants came in gay liveries, and carried the Fir
Tree into a large, beautiful parlor. All around the walls hung
pictures, and by the great stove stood large Chinese vases with
lions on the covers; there were rocking-chairs, silken sofas, great
tables covered with picture books, and toys worth a hundred
times a hundred dollars, at least the children said so. And the
Fir Tree was put into a great tub filled with sand; but no one
could see that it was a tub, for it was hung round with green
cloth, and stood on a large, many-colored carpet. Oh, how the
Tree trembled! What was to happen now? The servants, and
the young ladies also, decked it out. On one branch they hung
little nets, cut out of colored paper; every net was filled with
sweetmeats; golden apples and walnuts hung down, as if they
grew there, and more than a hundred little candles, red, white,
and blue, were fastened to the different boughs. Dolls that
looked exactly like real people&mdash;the tree had never seen such
before&mdash;swung among the foliage, and high on the summit of
the tree was fixed a tinsel star. It was splendid, particularly
splendid.</p>

<p>"This evening," said all, "this evening it will shine."</p>

<p>"Oh," thought the Tree, "that it were evening already!
Oh, that the lights may be soon lit up! When may that be done?
I wonder if trees will come out of the forest to look at me? Will
the sparrows fly against the panes? Shall I grow fast here, and
stand adorned in summer and winter?"</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[page&nbsp;240]</span>
<p>
Yes, he did not guess badly. But he had a complete backache
from mere longing, and the backache is just as bad for a
Tree as the headache for a person.</p>

<p>At last the candles were lighted. What a brilliance, what
splendor! The Tree trembled so in all its branches that one of
the candles set fire to a green twig, and it was scorched.</p>

<p>"Heaven preserve us!" cried the young ladies; and they hastily
put the fire out.</p>

<p>Now the Tree might not even tremble. Oh, that was terrible!
It was so afraid of setting fire to some of its ornaments, and
it was quite bewildered with all the brilliance. And now the
folding doors were thrown open, and a number of children
rushed in as if they would have overturned the whole Tree; the
older people followed more deliberately. The little ones stood
quite silent, but only for a minute; then they shouted till the
room rang: they danced gleefully round the Tree, and one
present after another was plucked from it.</p>

<p>"What are they about?" thought the Tree. "What's going
to be done?"</p>

<p>And the candles burned down to the twigs, and as they
burned down they were extinguished, and then the children
received permission to plunder the Tree. Oh! they rushed
in upon it, so that every branch cracked again: if it had not
been fastened by the top and by the golden star to the ceiling,
it would have fallen down.</p>

<p>The children danced about with their pretty toys. No
one looked at the Tree except one old man, who came up and
peeped among the branches, but only to see if a fig or an apple
had been forgotten.</p>

<p>"A story! A story!" shouted the children; and they drew
a little fat man toward the tree; and he sat down just beneath
it&mdash;"for then we shall be in the green wood," said he, "and
the tree may have the advantage of listening to my tale. But
I can only tell one. Will you hear the story of Ivede-Avede,
or of Klumpey-Dumpey, who fell downstairs, and still was
raised up to honor and married the Princess?"</p>

<p>"Ivede-Avede!" cried some, "Klumpey-Dumpey!" cried
others, and there was a great crying and shouting. Only the
<span class="left"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[page&nbsp;241]</span>
Fir Tree was quite silent, and thought, "Shall I not be in it?
Shall I have nothing to do in it?" But he had been in the
evening's amusement, and had done what was required of him.</p>

<p>And the fat man told about Klumpey-Dumpey who fell
downstairs, and yet was raised to honor and married the Princess.
And the children clapped their hands, and cried, "Tell
another! tell another!" for they wanted to hear about Ivede-Avede;
but they only got the story of Klumpey-Dumpey.
The Fir Tree stood quite silent and thoughtful; never had
the birds in the wood told such a story as that. Klumpey-Dumpey
fell downstairs and yet came to honor and married
the Princess!</p>

<p>"Yes, so it happens in the world!" thought the Fir Tree,
and believed it must be true, because that was such a nice man
who told it. "Well, who can know? Perhaps I shall fall
downstairs, too, and marry a Princess!" And it looked forward
with pleasure to being adorned again, the next evening,
with candles and toys, gold and fruit. "To-morrow I shall not
tremble," it thought.</p>

<p>"I will rejoice in all my splendor. To-morrow I shall
here the story of Klumpey-Dumpey again, and perhaps that
of Ivede-Avede, too."</p>

<p>And the Tree stood all night quiet and thoughtful.</p>

<p>In the morning the servants and the chambermaid came
in.</p>

<p>"Now my splendor will begin afresh," thought the Tree.
But they dragged him out of the room, and upstairs to the
garret, and here they put him in a dark corner where no daylight
shone.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this?" thought the Tree. "What
am I to do here? What is to happen?"</p>

<p>And he leaned against the wall, and thought, and thought.
And he had time enough, for days and nights went by, and nobody
came up; and when at length some one came, it was only
to put some great boxes in a corner. Now the Tree stood quite
hidden away, and the supposition is that it was quite forgotten.</p>

<p>"Now it's winter outside," thought the Tree. "The
earth is hard and covered with snow, and people cannot plant
<span class="left"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[page&nbsp;242]</span>
me; therefore I suppose I'm to be sheltered here until spring
comes. How considerate that is! How good people are!
If it were only not so dark here, and so terribly solitary!&mdash;not
even a little hare? That was pretty out there in the wood,
when the snow lay thick and the hare sprang past; yes, even
when he jumped over me; but then I did not like it. It is terribly
lonely up here!"</p>

<p>"Piep! piep!" said a little Mouse, and crept forward, and
then came another little one. They smelt at the Fir Tree, and
then slipped among the branches.</p>

<p>"It's horribly cold," said the two little Mice, "or else it
would be comfortable here. Don't you think so, you old Fir
Tree?"</p>

<p>"I'm not old at all," said the Fir Tree. "There are many
much older than I."</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?" asked the Mice. "And
what do you know?" They were dreadfully inquisitive.
"Tell us about the most beautiful spot on earth. Have you
been there? Have you been in the store room, where cheeses
lie on the shelves, and hams hang from the ceiling, where one
dances on tallow candles, and goes in thin and comes out fat?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that," replied the Tree; "but I know the
wood, where the sun shines and the birds sing."</p>

<p>And then it told all about its youth.</p>

<p>And the little Mice had never heard anything of the kind;
and they listened and said:</p>

<p>"What a number of things you have seen! How happy
you must have been!"</p>

<p>"I?" replied the Fir Tree; and it thought about what it
had told. "Yes, those were really quite happy times." But
then he told of the Christmas Eve, when he had been hung with
sweetmeats and candles.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the little Mice, "how happy you have been,
you old Fir Tree!"</p>

<p>"I'm not old at all," said the Tree. "I only came out of
the wood this winter. I'm only rather backward in my growth."</p>

<p>"What splendid stories you can tell!" said the little Mice.</p>

<p>And next night they came with four other little Mice, to
<span class="left"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[page&nbsp;243]</span>
hear what the Tree had to relate; and the more it said, the more
clearly did it remember everything, and thought, "Those were
quite merry days! But they may come again. Klumpey-Dumpey
fell downstairs and yet he married the Princess.
Perhaps I may marry a Princess too?" And then the Fir
Tree thought of a pretty little Birch Tree that grew out in the
forest: for the Fir Tree, that Birch was a real Princess.</p>

<p>"Who's Klumpey-Dumpey?" asked the little Mice.</p>

<p>And then the Fir Tree told the whole story. It could remember
every single word; and the little Mice were ready to leap to
the very top of the tree with pleasure. Next night a great many
more Mice came, and on Sunday two Rats even appeared; but
these thought the story was not pretty, and the little Mice were
sorry for that, for now they also did not like it so much as before.</p>

<p>"Do you only know one story?" asked the Rats.</p>

<p>"Only that one," replied the Tree. "I heard that on the
happiest evening of my life; I did not think then how happy I
was."</p>

<p>"That's a very miserable story. Don't you know any about
bacon and tallow candles&mdash;a store-room story?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Tree.</p>

<p>"Then we'd rather not hear you," said the Rats.</p>

<p>And they went back to their own people. The little Mice
at last stayed away also; and then the Tree sighed and said:</p>

<p>"It was very nice when they sat round me, the merry little
Mice, and listened when I spoke to them. Now that's past
too. But I shall remember to be pleased when they take
me out."</p>

<p>But when did that happen? Why, it was one morning that
people came and rummaged in the garret; the boxes were put
away, and the Tree brought out; they certainly threw him rather
roughly on the floor, but a servant dragged him away at once to
the stairs, where the daylight shone.</p>

<p>"Now life is beginning again!" thought the Tree.</p>

<p>It felt the fresh air and the first sunbeams, and now it was
out in the courtyard. Everything passed so quickly that the
Tree quite forgot to look at itself, there was so much to look at
all round. The courtyard was close to a garden, and here everything
<span class="left"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[page&nbsp;244]</span>
was blooming; the roses hung fresh and fragrant over the
little paling, the linden trees were in blossom, and the swallows
cried, "Quinze-wit! quinze-wit! my husband's come!" But
it was not the Fir Tree that they meant.</p>

<p>"Now I shall live!" said the Tree, rejoicingly, and spread its
branches far out; but, alas! they were all withered and yellow;
and it lay in the corner among nettles and weeds. The tinsel
star was still upon it, and shone in the bright sunshine.</p>

<p>In the courtyard a couple of the merry children were playing
who had danced round the tree at Christmas time, and had
rejoiced over it. One of the youngest ran up and tore off the
golden star.</p>

<p>"Look what is sticking to the ugly old fir tree!" said the
child, and he trod upon the branches till they cracked again
under his boots.</p>

<p>And the Tree looked at all the blooming flowers and the
splendor of the garden, and then looked at itself, and wished it
had remained in the dark corner of the garret; it thought of its
fresh youth in the wood, of the merry Christmas Eve, and of the
little Mice which had listened so pleasantly to the story of
Klumpey-Dumpey.</p>

<p>"Past! past!" said the old Tree. "Had I but rejoiced when
I could have done so! Past! past!"</p>

<p>And the servant came and chopped the Tree into little pieces;
a whole bundle lay there; it blazed brightly under the great
brewing kettle, and it sighed deeply, and each sigh was like a
little shot; and the children who were at play there ran up and
seated themselves at the fire, looked into it, and cried "Puff!
puff!" But at each explosion, which was a deep sigh, the Tree
thought of a summer day in the woods, or of a winter night there,
when the stars beamed; he thought of Christmas Eve and of
Klumpey-Dumpey, the only story he had ever heard or knew
how to tell; and then the Tree was burned.</p>

<p>The boys played in the garden, and the youngest had on his
breast a golden star, which the Tree had worn on its happiest
evening. Now that was past, and the Tree's life was past, and
the story is past too: past! past!&mdash;and that's the way with all
stories.</p>

<h2>THE DARNING-NEEDLE</h2>

<h4>BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HERE</b> was once a Darning-needle, who thought herself
so fine, she imagined she was an embroidering-needle.</p>

<p>"Take care, and mind you hold me tight!" she said to the
Fingers that took her out. "Don't let me fall! If I fall on the
ground I shall certainly never be found again, for I am so fine!"</p>

<p>"That's as it may be," said the Fingers; and they grasped
her round the body.</p>

<p>"See, I'm coming with a train!" said the Darning-needle,
and she drew a long thread after her, but there was no knot in
the thread.</p>

<p>The Fingers pointed the needle just at the cook's slipper, in
which the upper leather had burst, and was to be sewn together.</p>

<p>"That's vulgar work," said the Darning-needle. "I shall
never get through. I'm breaking! I'm breaking!" And she
really broke. "Did I not say so?" said the Darning-needle;
"I'm too fine!"</p>

<p>"Now it's quite useless," said the Fingers; but they were
obliged to hold her fast, all the same; for the cook dropped some
sealing-wax upon the needle, and pinned her handkerchief together
with it in front.</p>

<p>"So, now I'm a breast-pin!" said the Darning-needle. "I
knew very well that I should come to honor; when one is something,
one comes to something!"</p>

<p>And she laughed quietly to herself&mdash;and one can never see
when a darning-needle laughs. There she sat, as proud as if
she were in a state coach, and looked all about her.</p>

<p>"May I be permitted to ask if you are of gold?" she inquired
of the pin, her neighbor. "You have a very pretty appearance
and a peculiar head, but it is only little. You must take pains
to grow, for it's not every one that has sealing-wax dropped upon
him."</p>

<p>And the Darning-needle drew herself up so proudly that she
fell out of the handkerchief right into the sink, which the cook
was rinsing out.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[page&nbsp;246]</span>
<p>
"Now we're going on a journey," said the Darning-needle.
"If I only don't get lost!"</p>

<p>But she really was lost.</p>

<p>"I'm too fine for this world," she observed, as she lay in
the gutter. "But I know who I am, and there's always something
in that!"</p>

<p>So the Darning-needle kept her proud behavior, and did
not lose her good humor. And things of many kinds swam
over her, chips and straws and pieces of old newspapers.</p>

<p>"Only look how they sail!" said the Darning-needle.
"They don't know what is under them! I'm here, I remain
firmly here. See, there goes a chip thinking of nothing in
the world but of himself&mdash;of a chip! There's a straw going
by now. How he turns! how he twirls about! Don't think
only of yourself, you might easily run up against a stone. There
swims a bit of newspaper. What's written upon it has long
been forgotten, and yet it gives itself airs. I sit quietly and
patiently here. I know who I am, and I shall remain what I
am."</p>

<p>One day something lay close beside her that glittered
splendidly; then the Darning-needle believed that it was a
diamond; but it was a bit of broken bottle; and because it shone
the Darning-needle spoke to it, introducing herself as a breastpin.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are a diamond?" she observed.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, something of that kind."</p>

<p>And then each believed the other to be a very valuable
thing; and they began speaking about the world, and how very
conceited it was.</p>

<p>"I have been in a lady's box," said the Darning-needle,
"and this lady was a cook. She had five fingers on each hand,
and I never saw anything so conceited as those five fingers.
And yet they were only there that they might take me out of
the box and put me back into it."</p>

<p>"Were they of good birth?" asked the Bit of Bottle.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," replied the Darning-needle: "but very
haughty. There were five brothers, all of the finger family.
They kept very proudly together though they were of different
<span class="left"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[page&nbsp;247]</span>
lengths: the outermost, the thumbling, was short and fat;
he walked out in front of the ranks, and only had one joint in
his back, and could only make a single bow; but he said that if
he were hacked off a man, that man was useless for service in
war. Dainty-mouth, the second finger, thrust himself into
sweet and sour, pointed to sun and moon, and gave the impression
when they wrote. Longman, the third, looked at
all the others over his shoulder. Goldborder, the fourth, went
about with a golden belt round his waist; and little Playman
did nothing at all, and was proud of it. There was nothing
but bragging among them, and therefore I went away."</p>

<p>"And now we sit here and glitter!" said the Bit of Bottle.</p>

<p>At that moment more water came into the gutter, so that it
overflowed, and the Bit of Bottle was carried away.</p>

<p>"So he is disposed of," observed the Darning-needle. "I
remain here. I am too fine. But that's my pride, and my
pride is honorable." And proudly she sat there, and had many
great thoughts. "I could almost believe I had been born of
a sunbeam, I'm so fine! It really appears as if the sunbeams
were always seeking for me under the water. Ah! I'm so
fine that my mother cannot find me. If I had my old eye,
which broke off, I think I should cry; but, no, I should not do
that; it's not genteel to cry."</p>

<p>One day a couple of street boys lay grubbing in the gutter,
where they sometimes found old nails, farthings, and similar
treasures. It was dirty work, but they took great delight in
it.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried one, who had pricked himself with the Darning-needle,
"there's a fellow for you!"</p>

<p>"I'm not a fellow; I'm a young lady!" said the Darning-needle.</p>

<p>But nobody listened to her. The sealing-wax had come off,
and she had turned black; but black makes one look slender,
and she thought herself finer even than before.</p>

<p>"Here comes an eggshell sailing along!" said the boys;
and they stuck the Darning-needle fast in the eggshell.</p>

<p>"White walls, and black myself! that looks well," remarked
the Darning-needle. "Now one can see me. I only hope
<span class="left"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[page&nbsp;248]</span>
I shall not be seasick!" But she was not seasick at all. "It
is good against seasickness, if one has a steel stomach, and
does not forget that one is a little more than an ordinary person!
Now my seasickness is over. The finer one is, the more one can bear."</p>

<p>"Crack!" went the eggshell, for a wagon went over her.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens, how it crushes one!" said the Darning-needle.
"I'm getting seasick now&mdash;I'm quite sick."</p>

<p>But she was not really sick, though the wagon went over
her; she lay there at full length, and there she may lie.</p>

<h2>THUMBELINA</h2>

<h4>BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HE</b> had a little house of her own, a little garden too, this
woman of whom I am going to tell you, but for all that she
was not quite happy.</p>

<p>"If only I had a little child of my own," she said, "how the
walls would ring with her laughter, and how the flowers would
brighten at her coming. Then, indeed, I should be quite happy."</p>

<p>And an old witch heard what the woman wished, and said,
"Oh, but that is easily managed. Here is a barley-corn.
Plant it in a flower-pot and tend it carefully, and then you will
see what will happen."</p>

<p>The woman was in a great hurry to go home and plant the
barley-corn, but she did not forget to say "thank you" to the
old witch. She not only thanked her, she even stayed to give her
six silver pennies.</p>

<p>Then she hurried away to her home, took a flower-pot and
planted her precious barley-corn.</p>

<p>And what do you think happened? Almost before the corn
was planted, up shot a large and beautiful flower. It was still
unopened. The petals were folded closely together, but it looked
like a tulip. It really was a tulip, a red and yellow one, too.</p>

<p>The woman loved flowers. She stooped and kissed the
<span class="left"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[page&nbsp;249]</span>
beautiful bud. As her lips touched the petals, they burst open,
and oh! wonder of wonders! there, in the very middle of the
flower, there sat a little child. Such a tiny, pretty little maiden she was.</p>

<p>They called her Thumbelina. That was because she was
no bigger than the woman's thumb.</p>

<p>And where do you think she slept? A little walnut shell,
lined with blue, that was her cradle.</p>

<p>When she slept little Thumbelina lay in her cradle on a tiny
heap of violets, with the petal of a pale pink rose to cover her.</p>

<p>And where do you think she played? A table was her playground.
On the table the woman placed a plate of water.
Little Thumbelina called that her lake.</p>

<p>Round the plate were scented flowers, the blossoms lying on
the edge, while the pale green stalks reached thirstily down to
the water.</p>

<p>In the lake floated a large tulip leaf. This was Thumbelina's
little boat. Seated there she sailed from side to side of her little
lake, rowing cleverly with two white horse hairs. As she rowed
backwards and forwards she sang softly to herself. The woman
listening heard, and thought she had never known so sweet a
song.</p>

<p>And now such a sad thing happened.</p>

<p>In through the broken window-pane hopped a big toad, oh!
such an ugly big toad. She hopped right on to the table, where
Thumbelina lay dreaming in her tiny cradle, under the pale pink
rose leaf.</p>

<p>She peeped at her, this ugly old toad.</p>

<p>"How beautiful the little maiden is," she croaked. "She
will make a lovely bride for my handsome son." And she lifted
the little cradle, with Thumbelina in it, and hopped out through
the broken window-pane, down into the garden.</p>

<p>At the foot of the garden was a broad stream. Here, under
the muddy banks lived the old toad with her son.</p>

<p>How handsome she thought him! But he was really very
ugly. Indeed, he was exactly like his mother.</p>

<p>When he saw little Thumbelina in her tiny cradle, he croaked
with delight.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[page&nbsp;250]</span>
<p>
"Do not make so much noise," said his mother, "or you will
wake the tiny creature. We may lose her if we are not careful.
The slightest breeze would waft her far away. She is as light as
gossamer."</p>

<p>Then the old toad carried Thumbelina out into the middle
of the stream. "She will be safe here," she said, as she laid her
gently on one of the leaves of a large water lily, and paddled back to her son.</p>

<p>"We will make ready the best rooms under the mud," she told
him, "and then you and the little maiden will be married."</p>

<p>Poor little Thumbelina! She had not seen the ugly big toad
yet, nor her ugly son.</p>

<p>When she woke up early in the morning, how she wept!
Water all around her! How could she reach the shore? Poor
little Thumbelina!</p>

<p>Down under the mud the old toad was very busy, decking
the best room with buttercups and buds of water-lilies to make it
gay for her little daughter-in-law, Thumbelina.</p>

<p>"Now we will go to bring her little bed and place it ready,"
said the old toad, and together she and her son swam out to the
leaf where little Thumbelina sat.</p>

<p>"Here is my handsome son," she said, "he is to be your
husband," and she bowed low in the water, for she wished to be
very polite to the little maiden.</p>

<p>"Croak, croak," was all the young toad could say, as he
looked at his pretty little bride.</p>

<p>Then they took away the tiny little bed, and Thumbelina
was left all alone.</p>

<p>How the tears stained her pretty little face! How fast they
fell into the stream! Even the fish as they swam hither and
thither thought, "How it rains to-day," as the tiny drops fell
thick and fast.</p>

<p>They popped up their heads and saw the forlorn little maiden.</p>

<p>"She shall not marry the ugly toad," they said, as they looked
with eager eyes at the pretty child. "No, she shall not marry
the ugly toad."</p>

<p>But what could the little fish do to help Thumbelina?</p>

<p>Oh! they were such clever little fish!</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[page&nbsp;251]</span>
<p>
They found the green stem which held the leaf on which
Thumbelina sat. They bit it with their little sharp teeth, and
they never stopped biting, till at last they bit the green stem
through; and away, down the stream, floated the leaf, carrying
with it little Thumbelina.</p>

<p>"Free, free!" she sang, and her voice tinkled as a chime of
fairy bells. "Free, free!" she sang merrily as she floated down
the stream, away, far away out of reach of the ugly old toad and
her ugly son.</p>

<p>And as she floated on, the little wild birds sang round her,
and on the banks the little wild harebells bowed to her.</p>

<p>Butterflies were flitting here and there in the sunshine. A
pretty little white one fluttered on to the leaf on which sat
Thumbelina. He loved the tiny maiden so well that he settled
down beside her.</p>

<p>Now she was quite happy! Birds around her, flowers near
her, and the water gleaming like gold in the summer sunshine.
What besides could little Thumbelina wish?</p>

<p>She took off her sash and threw one end of it round the butterfly.
The other end she fastened firmly to the leaf. On
and on floated the leaf, the little maiden and the butterfly.</p>

<p>Suddenly a great cockchafer buzzed along. Alas! he caught
sight of little Thumbelina. He flew to her, put his claw round
her tiny waist and carried her off, up on to a tree.</p>

<p>Poor little Thumbelina! How frightened she was! How
grieved she was, too, for had she not lost her little friend the
butterfly?</p>

<p>Would he fly away, she wondered, or would her sash hold
him fast?</p>

<p>The cockchafer was charmed with the little maiden. He
placed her tenderly on the largest leaf he could find. He
gathered honey for her from the flowers, and as she sipped it,
he sat near and told her how beautiful she looked.</p>

<p>But there were other chafers living in the tree, and when
they came to see little Thumbelina, they said, "She is not
pretty at all."</p>

<p>"She has only two legs," said one.</p>

<p>"She has no feelers," said another.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[page&nbsp;252]</span>
<p>
Some said she was too thin, others that she was too fat, and
then they all buzzed and hummed together, "How ugly she is,
how ugly she is!" But all the time little Thumbelina was the
prettiest, daintiest little maiden that ever lived.</p>

<p>And now the cockchafer who had flown off with little
Thumbelina thought he had been rather foolish to admire
her.</p>

<p>He looked at her again. "Pretty? No, after all she was
not very pretty." He would have nothing to do with her, and
away he and all the other chafers flew. Only first they carried
little Thumbelina down from the tree and placed her on a daisy.
She wept because she was so ugly&mdash;so ugly that the chafers could
not live with her. But all the time, you know, she was the
prettiest little maiden in the world.</p>

<p>She was living all alone in the wood now, but it was summer
and she could not feel sad or lonely while the warm golden sunshine
touched her so gently, while the birds sang to her, and the
flowers bowed to her.</p>

<p>Yes, little Thumbelina was happy. She ate honey from the
flowers, and drank dew out of the golden buttercups and danced
and sang the livelong day.</p>

<p>But summer passed away and autumn came. The birds
began to whisper of flying to warmer countries, and the flowers
began to fade and hang their heads, and as autumn passed away,
winter came, cold, dreary winter.</p>

<p>Thumbelina shivered with cold. Her little frock was thin
and old. She would certainly be frozen to death, she thought,
as she wrapped herself up in a withered leaf.</p>

<p>Then the snow began to fall, and each snowflake seemed to
smother her. She was so very tiny.</p>

<p>Close to the wood lay a corn-field. The beautiful golden
grain had been carried away long ago, now there was only dry
short stubble. But to little Thumbelina the stubble was like a
great forest.</p>

<p>She walked through the hard field. She was shaking with
cold. All at once she saw a little door just before her. She
looked again&mdash;yes, it was a door.</p>

<p>The field-mouse had made a little house under the stubble,
<span class="left"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[page&nbsp;253]</span>
and lived so cosily there. She had a big room full of corn, and
she had a kitchen and pantry as well.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall get some food here," thought the cold and
hungry little maiden, as she stood knocking at the door, just like
a tiny beggar child. She had had nothing to eat for two long
days. Oh, she was very hungry!</p>

<p>"What a tiny thing you are!" said the field-mouse, as she
opened the door and saw Thumbelina. "Come in and dine
with me."</p>

<p>How glad Thumbelina was, and how she enjoyed dining
with the field-mouse.</p>

<p>She behaved so prettily that the old field-mouse told her she
might live with her while the cold weather lasted. "And you
shall keep my room clean and neat, and you shall tell me stories,"
she added.</p>

<p>That is how Thumbelina came to live with the field-mouse
and to meet Mr. Mole.</p>

<p>"We shall have a visitor soon," said the field-mouse. "My
neighbor, Mr. Mole, comes to see me every week-day. His
house is very large, and he wears a beautiful coat of black velvet.
Unfortunately, he is blind. If you tell him your prettiest stories
he may marry you."</p>

<p>Now the mole was very wise and very clever, but how could
little Thumbelina ever care for him? Why, he did not love the
sun, nor the flowers, and he lived in a house underground. No,
Thumbelina did not wish to marry the mole.</p>

<p>However she must sing to him when he came to visit his
neighbor the field-mouse. When she had sung "Ladybird,
Ladybird, fly away home," and "Boys and girls come out to
play," the mole was charmed, and thought he would like to
marry the little maiden with the beautiful voice.</p>

<p>Then he tried to be very agreeable. He invited the field-mouse
and Thumbelina to walk along the underground passage
he had dug between their houses. Mr. Mole was very fond of
digging underground.</p>

<p>As it was dark the mole took a piece of tinder-wood in his
mouth and led the way. The tinder-wood shone like a torch in
the dark passage.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[page&nbsp;254]</span>
<p>
A little bird lay in the passage, a little bird who had not
flown away when the flowers faded and the cold winds blew.</p>

<p>It was dead, the mole said.</p>

<p>When he reached the bird, the mole stopped and pushed his
nose right up through the ceiling to make a hole, through which
the daylight might shine.</p>

<p>There lay the swallow, his wings pressed close to his side
His little head and legs drawn in under his feathers. He had
died of cold.</p>

<p>"Poor little swallow!" thought Thumbelina. All wild birds
were her friends. Had they not sung to her and fluttered round
her all the long glad summer days?</p>

<p>But the mole kicked the swallow with his short legs. "That
one will sing no more," he said roughly. "It must be sad to be
born a bird and to be able only to sing and fly. I am thankful
none of my children will be birds," and he proudly smoothed
down his velvet coat.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the field-mouse; "what can a bird do but sing?
When the cold weather comes it is useless."</p>

<p>Thumbelina said nothing. Only when the others moved
on, she stooped down and stroked the bird gently with her tiny
hand, and kissed its closed eyes.</p>

<p>That night the little maiden could not sleep. "I will go to
see the poor swallow again," she thought.</p>

<p>She got up out of her tiny bed. She wove a little carpet out
of hay. Down the long underground passage little Thumbelina
walked, carrying the carpet. She reached the bird at last, and
spread the carpet gently round him. She fetched warm cotton
and laid it over the bird.</p>

<p>"Even down on the cold earth he will be warm now," thought
the gentle little maiden.</p>

<p>"Farewell," she said sadly, "farewell, little bird! Did you
sing to me through the long summer days, when the leaves were
green and the sky was blue? Farewell, little swallow!" and
she stooped to press her tiny cheeks against the soft feathers.</p>

<p>As she did so, she heard&mdash;what could it be? Pit, pat, pit,
pat! Could the bird be alive? Little Thumbelina listened still.
Yes, it was the beating of the little bird's heart that she heard.
<span class="left"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[page&nbsp;255]</span>
He had not been dead after all, only frozen with cold. The little
carpet and the covering the little maid had brought warmed
the bird. He would get well now.</p>

<p>What a big bird he seemed to Thumbelina! She was
almost afraid now, for she was so tiny. She was tiny, but she
was brave. Drawing the covering more closely round the
poor swallow, she brought her own little pillow, that the
bird's head might rest softly.</p>

<p>Thumbelina stole out again the next night. "Would the
swallow look at her," she wondered.</p>

<p>Yes, he opened his eyes, and looked at little Thumbelina,
who stood there with a tiny torch of tinder-wood.</p>

<p>"Thanks, thanks, little Thumbelina," he twittered feebly.
"Soon I shall grow strong and fly out in the bright sunshine
once more; thanks, thanks, little maiden."</p>

<p>"Oh! but it is too cold, it snows and freezes, for now it is
winter," said Thumbelina. "Stay here and be warm, and I will
take care of you," and she brought the swallow water in a leaf.</p>

<p>And the little bird told her all his story,&mdash;how he had tried
to fly to the warm countries, and how he had torn his wing on a
blackthorn bush and fallen to the ground. But he could not
tell her how he had come to the underground passage.</p>

<p>All winter the swallow stayed there, and Thumbelina was
often in the long passage, with her little torch of tinder-wood.
But the mole and the field-mouse did not know how Thumbelina
tended and cared for the swallow.</p>

<p>At last spring came, and the sun sent its warmth down
where the swallow lay in the underground passage.</p>

<p>Little Thumbelina opened the hole which the mole had
made in the ceiling, and the sunshine streamed down on the
swallow and the little girl.</p>

<p>How the swallow longed to soar away, up and up, to be lost
to sight in the blue, blue sky!</p>

<p>"Come with me, little Thumbelina," said the swallow,
"come with me to the blue skies and the green woods."</p>

<p>But Thumbelina remembered how kind the field-mouse
had been to her when she was cold and hungry, and she would
not leave her.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[page&nbsp;256]</span>
<p>
"Farewell! farewell! then, little maiden," twittered the
swallow as he flew out and up, up into the sunshine.</p>

<p>Thumbelina loved the swallow dearly. Her eyes were full
of tears as she watched the bird disappearing till he was only a
tiny speck of black.</p>

<p>And now sad days came to little Thumbelina.</p>

<p>The golden corn was once more waving in the sunshine above
the house of the field-mouse, but Thumbelina must not go out
lest she lose herself among the corn.</p>

<p>Not go out in the bright sunshine! Oh, poor little Thumbelina!</p>

<p>"You must get your wedding clothes ready this summer,"
said the field-mouse. "You must be well provided with linen and
worsted. My neighbor the mole will wish a well-dressed bride."</p>

<p>The mole had said he wished to marry little Thumbelina
before the cold winter came again.</p>

<p>So Thumbelina sat at the spinning-wheel through the long
summer days, spinning and weaving with four little spiders to
help her.</p>

<p>In the evening the mole came to visit her. "Summer will
soon be over," he said, "and we shall be married."</p>

<p>But oh! little Thumbelina did not wish the summer to end.</p>

<p>Live with the dull old mole, who hated the sunshine, who
would not listen to the song of the birds&mdash;live underground with
him! Little Thumbelina wished the summer would never end.</p>

<p>The spinning and weaving were over now. All the wedding
clothes were ready. Autumn was come.</p>

<p>"Only four weeks and the wedding-day will have come,"
said the field-mouse.</p>

<p>And little Thumbelina wept.</p>

<p>"I will not marry the tiresome old mole," she said.</p>

<p>"I shall bite you with my white tooth if you talk such nonsense,"
said the field-mouse. "Among all my friends not one
of them has such a fine velvet coat as the mole. His cellars are
full and his rooms are large. You ought to be glad to marry so
well," she ended.</p>

<p>"Was there no escape from the underground home?" little
Thumbelina wondered.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[page&nbsp;257]</span>
<p>
The wedding-day came. The mole arrived to fetch his little
bride.</p>

<p>How could she say good-by for ever to the beautiful sunshine?</p>

<p>"Farewell, farewell!" she cried, and waved her little hands
towards the glorious sun.</p>

<p>"Farewell, farewell!" she cried, and threw her tiny arms
round a little red flower growing at her feet.</p>

<p>"Tell the dear swallow, when he comes again," she whispered
to the flower, "tell him I will never forget him."</p>

<p>"Tweet, tweet!" what was that Thumbelina heard?
"Tweet, tweet!" Could it be the swallow?</p>

<p>The flutter of wings was round her. Little Thumbelina
looked. How glad she was, for there, indeed, was the little bird
she had tended and cared for so long. She told him, weeping,
she must not stay. She must marry the mole and live underground,
and never see the sun, the glorious sun.</p>

<p>"Come with me, come with me, little Thumbelina," twittered
the swallow. "You can sit on my back, and I will fly with you
to warmer countries, far from the tiresome old mole. Over
mountains and seas we will fly to the country where the summer
never ends, and the sunlight always shines."</p>

<p>Then little Thumbelina seated herself on her dear swallow's
back, and put her tiny feet on his outstretched wing. She tied herself
firmly with her little sash to the strongest feather of the bird.</p>

<p>And the swallow soared high into the air. High above
forests and lakes, high above the big mountains that were crested
with snow, he soared.</p>

<p>And little Thumbelina shivered as she felt the cold air, but
soon she crept under the bird's warm feathers, and only pushed
out her little head to see the beauty all around her.</p>

<p>They had reached the warm countries now. The sun was
more brilliant here, the flowers more radiant.</p>

<p>On and on flew the swallow, till he came to a white marble
palace. Half-ruined it was, and vine leaves trailed up the long
slender pillars. And among the broad, green leaves many a
swallow had built his nest, and one of these nests belonged to
Thumbelina's little swallow.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[page&nbsp;258]</span>
<p>
"This is my home," said the bird, "but you shall live in one
of these brilliant flowers, in the loveliest of them all'."</p>

<p>And little Thumbelina clapped her hands with joy.</p>

<p>The swallow flew with her to a stately sunflower, and set her
carefully on one of the broad yellow petals.</p>

<p>But think, what was her surprise! In the very heart of the
flower stood a little Prince, fair and transparent as crystal. On
his head he wore a crown of gold, on his shoulders a pair of
delicate wings, and he was small, every bit as small as Thumbelina.
He was the spirit of the flower.</p>

<p>For you know in each flower there is a spirit, a tiny little
boy or girl, but this little Prince was King of all the flower spirits.</p>

<p>The little King thought Thumbelina the loveliest maiden
he had ever seen. He took off his golden crown and placed it
on the tiny head of the little maid, and in a silvery voice he
asked, "Will you be my bride, little Thumbelina, and reign
with me over the flower spirits?"</p>

<p>How glad Thumbelina was!</p>

<p>The little King wished to marry her. Yes, she would be his
little Queen.</p>

<p>Then out of each blossom stepped tiny little children. They
came to pay their homage to little Thumbelina.</p>

<p>Each one brought her a present, and the most beautiful of
all the presents was a pair of wings, delicate as gossamer.
And when they were fastened on the shoulders of the little
Queen, she could fly from flower to flower.</p>

<p>And the swallow sat on his nest above, and sang his sweetest
bridal song for the wedding of little Thumbelina.</p>

<h2>THE TINDER-BOX</h2>

<h4>BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">A</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>STORY</b> about a tinder-box? Yes, but then it was such a
wonderful one! Why, it must certainly have been a
magic box!</p>

<p>It belonged to an old witch, this tinder-box, but it had been
<span class="left"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[page&nbsp;259]</span>
left right down inside a tree by the ugly old witch's grandmother.
But get it again she must, for she knew it really was a magic
tinder-box.</p>

<p>But how could she get it?</p>

<p>Ah! here was her chance.</p>

<p>Tramp, tramp; right, left, right, left. She heard the steps
come nearer and nearer. She looked! There was a soldier
coming along; tramp, tramp.</p>

<p>She could see him now, with a knapsack on his back, and his
sword at his side.</p>

<p>The soldier had been to the wars and was coming home.</p>

<p>"Good evening," said the witch, as he came close to her.
"Good evening; what a bright sword you wear, and what a big
knapsack! You shall have as much money as you wish for
yourself!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, old witch," said the soldier. But he did not
tell her that she did not look as though she had much money to
spare. He was too wise to say anything but, "Thank you, old
witch."</p>

<p>"Do you see that big tree?" she said, and she pointed to one
that stood close by the wayside. "It is hollow inside. Climb
up to the top, and you will see a hole. It is large. You must
creep through it and let yourself down, right down under the tree.
Tie a rope round your waist, and I will haul you up again when
you call."</p>

<p>"But what am I to do under the tree?" asked the soldier.</p>

<p>"What are you to do? Why, did I not tell you you should
have money. It is there, under the tree, copper, silver, gold.
Gold!" cried the witch, in a rough and eager voice. "When
you come to the bottom of the tree there is a large passage. It
is quite light, indeed it is ablaze with light. More than a hundred
lamps are burning. There you will see three doors. The
keys are in the keyholes. Unlock the doors and walk in. In
the first room in the middle of the floor, is a big box. On the
top of it sits a dog. He has big eyes, they are as big as saucers,
but do not let that trouble you. You shall have my blue checked
apron. Spread it on the floor. Go forward quickly, seize the
dog and place him on it. After that is done, you can open the
<span class="left"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[page&nbsp;260]</span>
box, and take out as much money as you wish. It is true the box
holds only copper coins, but if you would rather have silver, just
walk into the next room. There sits another dog, on another
box, with big eyes, eyes as big as&mdash;oh, as big as mill-wheels, but
never mind that. Place the dog on my apron, then open the box
and take as much silver as you wish. But if you would rather
have gold, why, then open the third door. There you will see
another dog, sitting on another box. This one is tremendous,
quite gigantic, and he has eyes, oh! such great, rolling eyes!
They are as large as the Round Tower. He is a dog indeed, but
do not let that trouble you. Place him on my blue checked
apron and he will not hurt you. Then take gold, as much
gold as ever you wish."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" said the soldier. You see he had been to the
wars and was a brave man. "Splendid! But what am I to
give you, old witch? You will wish something, I am quite certain
of that."</p>

<p>"No," said the witch: "I do not wish one single coin. But
I do wish my old tinder-box. My grandmother left it behind
her, the last time she went down the tree."</p>

<p>"Well, tie the rope round my waist," said the soldier.</p>

<p>"Here it is," said the witch, "and here is my blue checked
apron. It is very important."</p>

<p>Up the tree climbed the soldier, into the tree he crept through
the hole at the top, and down, down the hollow inside he slipped,
and there he was, in a wide passage, lighted, as the witch had
said, by a hundred burning lamps.</p>

<p>The soldier unlocked the first door he saw. There sat the
dog with eyes as big as saucers, staring at him in great surprise.</p>

<p>"I must obey my orders," thought the soldier.</p>

<p>He placed the witch's apron on the floor, seized the dog
bravely, and placed him on the apron.</p>

<p>Then he opened the box. It was full of copper coins. He
crammed as many as he could into his pocket, shut the lid, placed
the dog again on the box, and passed on to the second door.</p>

<p>He unlocked it. Yes! there sat another dog on another box,
with great eyes, as big as mill-wheels.</p>

<p>"If you stare at me so hard, you will hurt your eyes," said
<span class="left"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[page&nbsp;261]</span>
the soldier, and thought what a joke he had made. Then he
seized the dog, placed it on the witch's apron, and raised the lid
of the second box.</p>

<p>Silver, every coin was silver! The soldier threw away all
his copper coins in a great hurry. He must have silver. He
stuffed his pockets and his knapsack with the silver coins, and
clapped his hands. He was rich now.</p>

<p>On he went to the third room. He unlocked it. There indeed
was another box and another dog, and oh, horrible! the
soldier almost shut his eyes. The dog had eyes, great big rolling
eyes, eyes as large as the Round Tower. And they would not
keep still. No, round and round they rolled.</p>

<p>But the soldier was brave; he had been to the wars.</p>

<p>"Good evening," he said, and he lifted his hat respectfully,
for never before in all his life, had he seen so big, so enormous a
creature.</p>

<p>Then he walked straight up to the dog. Could he lift him?
Yes, he took the immense animal in his arms, set him on the
witch's apron, and opened the third box.</p>

<p>Gold! It was full of gold. He would be able to buy the
whole town, and all the sugar-plums, and all the tin soldiers, and
all the rocking-horses and whips in the world.</p>

<p>The soldier was delighted. He threw away his silver
money. Silver! He did not want silver. Here was gold, gold!</p>

<p>He filled his pockets and his knapsack, but he could not bear
to stop there. No, he crammed his cap and his boots so full
that he could hardly walk. He was really rich at last. He
shut the lid, placed the dog again on the box, and went out of the
room, along the passage.</p>

<p>Then he shouted up the tree, "Halloo, old witch! haul me up
again."</p>

<p>"Have you got the tinder-box?" said the witch.</p>

<p>"Oh, that I had quite forgotten," answered the soldier, and
back he went to fetch it.</p>

<p>When he came back the witch took the rope and hauled and
hauled, till there was the soldier, once more, safe on the high
road, just as he was before, only now he was rich, so rich that he
had become very bold.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[page&nbsp;262]</span>
<p>
He had gold in his pockets, gold in his knapsack, gold in his
cap, gold in his boots.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with the tinder-box, just tell me
that?" said the soldier.</p>

<p>"That is no business of yours," said the witch. "You have
the gold, give me the tinder-box!"</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" said the soldier. He had grown rude as well as
rich, you see. "Rubbish&mdash;take your choice&mdash;tell me at once
what you mean to do with the tinker-box, or I will draw my
sword and cut off your head."</p>

<p>"I won't tell you," screamed the witch.</p>

<p>Then the soldier cut off her head, and the poor witch lay
there dead. But the soldier did not stay to look at her. In a
great hurry he took all his gold and tied it up in the blue checked
apron.</p>

<p>He slung it across his shoulder, put the tinder-box in his
pocket, and marched off to town.</p>

<p>How grand he felt! What heaps of gold he had in his bundle!</p>

<p>When the soldier reached the town he walked straight to the
finest hotel, and asked for the best rooms, and for dinner ordered
all his favorite puddings and fruits.</p>

<p>The servant who cleaned his boots tossed her head. "Shabby
boots for a rich man to wear," she said.</p>

<p>But next day the soldier had bought himself very grand new
boots, and gay clothing, so that no one could possibly call him
shabby.</p>

<p>Shabby! No, he was a great man now, and people crowded
round this rich fellow, told him all the sights there were to be
seen in their city, all about their King too, and the beautiful
Princess, his daughter.</p>

<p>"I should like to see her, this wonderful Princess," said the
soldier.</p>

<p>"But you cannot see her," they told him. "She lives, the
beautiful Princess, in a great copper castle, with walls and towers
all round. Only the King visits her there, for it was once foretold
that she would marry a common soldier, and that our King
does not wish."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[page&nbsp;263]</span>

<p>"I must see her once, just once," thought the soldier. But
how was he going to find the way into the castle, that was the
question?</p>

<p>Meanwhile he led a merry life. He drove about in the
King's Park; he went to the theater; he gave money to the poor,
because he remembered how miserable it was to have no money
in his own pocket.</p>

<p>The soldier was always gaily dressed now. He had a great
many friends who said he was a real gentleman, and that pleased
him very much.</p>

<p>And so he went on day after day, spending money and giving
money, but getting none, till at last the gold came to an end.
He had only two copper coins left: he was only a poor soldier
once more.</p>

<p>Leaving the grand hotel he went to live in a small room.
He found a tiny attic, just under a roof, up, oh! so many stairs.
Here he lived, mending his own clothes, brushing his own boots.
He had no visitors, for his grand friends would not take the
trouble to walk up so many stairs to his little attic.</p>

<p>Hungry? Yes, he was hungry too, and as he had no money
to buy even a farthing candle, he had to sit alone in the dark.</p>

<p>One evening he suddenly thought of the witch's tinder-box.
Surely in it there were matches.</p>

<p>The soldier opened it eagerly. Yes, there lay the matches.
He seized one and struck it on the tinder-box.</p>

<p>No sooner had he done this, than the door burst suddenly
open, and there, there, staring at him, stood the dog with eyes as
big as saucers.</p>

<p>"What does my master command?" asked the dog.</p>

<p>"No wonder the old witch wished the tinder-box for her very
own," thought the soldier. Aloud he said to the dog, "Fetch
me some money," and the dog instantly vanished to do his
master's bidding.</p>

<p>He was back in a moment, and lo! in his mouth was a big
bag, full of pennies.</p>

<p>"Why, this is a magic box," said the soldier. "I have a
treasure indeed." And so he had, for listen! Strike the box
once, the dog with eyes as large as saucers appeared. Strike it
<span class="left"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[page&nbsp;264]</span>
twice and the dog with eyes as big as mill-wheels appeared.
Strike it thrice and there appeared the monster dog with eyes
that rolled round and round and were as large as the Round
Tower itself. All three dogs did the soldier's bidding.</p>

<p>Now the soldier could have gold again. Gold as much as
ever he wished.</p>

<p>He moved once more to the grand rooms in the fine hotel.
He had gay clothes again; and now, strangely enough, all his
friends came to see him and liked him as much as ever.</p>

<p>One evening the soldier's thoughts wandered away to the
beautiful Princess, the beautiful Princess who was shut up so
safely in the great copper palace.</p>

<p>"It is ridiculous that no one sees the Princess," thought the
soldier. "I want to see her, and I shall."</p>

<p>He pulled out his tinder-box, struck a light, and lo! there
stood the dog with eyes as large as saucers.</p>

<p>"It is the middle of the night," said the soldier, "but I must
see the Princess, if it is only for a moment."</p>

<p>The dog bounded out of the door, and before the soldier had
time to wonder what he would do or say if the beautiful Princess
really appeared, there she was.</p>

<p>Yes, there she was, fast asleep on the dog's back. She was
beautiful, so beautiful that the soldier was quite sure that she
was a real Princess. He stooped and kissed her hand. She
was so beautiful he could not help it. Then off ran the dog,
back to the copper palace with the Princess.</p>

<p>"I had such a strange dream last night," the Princess told
the King and Queen at breakfast next morning. "I dreamed
that an enormous dog came and carried me off to a soldier, and
the soldier kissed my hand. It was a strange dream," she
murmured.</p>

<p>"The Princess must not be left alone to-night," said the
Queen. "She may be frightened if she dreams again." And
she told an old dame who lived at court to sit in the Princess's
room at night.</p>

<p>But what would the Queen have said if she had known that
what the Princess told them was no dream, but something that
had really and truly happened?</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[page&nbsp;265]</span>

<p>Well, that evening the soldier thought he would like to see
the Princess again.</p>

<p>He struck a light, and there stood one of his obedient dogs.</p>

<p>"Bring the Princess," ordered the soldier, and the dog vanished
to do his master's will.</p>

<p>The old dame sat beside the Princess's bed. She had heard
all about the Princess's dream.</p>

<p>"Was she dreaming herself now?" she wondered. She
pinched herself.&mdash;No, she was wide awake, yet she saw a dog, a
real dog with eyes as large as saucers, in front of her.</p>

<p>The dog seized the Princess, and ran off; but although he
ran very quickly, the old dame found time to put on her goloshes
before she followed.</p>

<p>How she panted along! How she ran, the faithful old dame!
She was just in time to see the Princess on the dog's back disappear
into a large house.</p>

<p>"I shall mark the house, so that I may know it in the morning,"
she thought. And she took a piece of white chalk and
made a great white cross on the door.</p>

<p>Then she walked home and slept.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the dog carried the Princess back to the
copper palace, and noticed the great white cross on the door of
the hotel where his master lived.</p>

<p>And what do you think he did? Oh, he was a wise dog.
He took a piece of chalk, and he put a great white cross on every
door in the town.</p>

<p>Early next morning the King and Queen and all the lords and
ladies of the court were astir. They had heard the old dame's
story, and were going to see the house with the great white cross.</p>

<p>They had scarcely started, when the King's eyes fell on a
great white cross! "Here it is," cried the King eagerly.</p>

<p>"What nonsense you talk, my dear! it is here," said the
Queen, for almost at the same moment she too had seen a door
with a great white cross.</p>

<p>Then all the lords and ladies cried: "It is here, it is here," as
one after another they saw doors marked with great white crosses.
The hubbub was terrible, and the poor old dame was quite bewildered.
How could she tell which door she had marked? It
<span class="left"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[page&nbsp;266]</span>
was quite useless. The dog had perplexed everybody, and they
went back to the copper palace knowing no more than when they
left it.</p>

<p>But the Queen was a clever woman. She could do more
than just sit very properly on a throne.</p>

<p>The same evening, she took her big gold scissors and cut up a
large piece of silk into small pieces. These she sewed together
into a pretty little bag. Then she filled the bag with the finest
grains of wheat. With her own hands she tied the bag round the
Princess's waist, after which she took her gold scissors again and
cut a tiny little hole in the bag, a hole just big enough to let the
grains of wheat drop out whenever the Princess moved.</p>

<p>That night the dog came again and carried the Princess off to
the soldier, and the soldier wished he were a Prince, for then he
would marry this beautiful Princess.</p>

<p>Now although the dog had very big eyes, eyes as large as saucers,
he did not notice the tiny grains of wheat as they dropped
out all along the road from the palace to the soldier's window.
Under the window the dog stopped and climbed up the wall with
the Princess, into the soldier's room.</p>

<p>The next morning the King and Queen followed the little grains
of wheat and very easily found out where the Princess had been.</p>

<p>Then the soldier was seized and put into prison.</p>

<p>Oh, how dark and tiresome it was! But it was worse than
that one day, when they told him he was to be hanged, "hanged
to-morrow," they told him.</p>

<p>What a fright the soldier was in, and, worst of all, he had left
his tinder-box at the hotel.</p>

<p>Morning came! Through the narrow bars of his little window
the soldier could see the people all hurrying out of town.
They were going to see him hanged.</p>

<p>He heard the drums, he saw the soldiers marching along.
He wished he were marching with them. Alas, alas! that could
never be now&mdash;</p>

<p>A little shoemaker's apprentice, with a leather apron, came
running along. He was in such a hurry that he lost one of his
slippers. It fell close under the soldier's window, as he sat peering
out through the narrow bars.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[page&nbsp;267]</span>

<p>The soldier called to the boy, "There is no hurry, for I am
still here. Nothing will happen till I go. I will give you two-pence
if you will run to the house where I used to live and fetch
me my tinder-box. You must run all the way."</p>

<p>The shoemaker's boy thought he would like to earn twopence,
and off he raced to bring the tinder-box.</p>

<p>He found it. "A useless little box," he said to himself, but
back he raced with it to the soldier; and then&mdash;what do you
think happened?</p>

<p>Outside the town the scaffold had been raised, the soldiers
were drawn up round it, as well as crowds of people.</p>

<p>The King and Queen were there too, seated on a magnificent
throne, exactly opposite the judges and councilors.</p>

<p>The rope was being put round the soldier's neck, when he
turned to the King and Queen and earnestly entreated one last
favor&mdash;only to be allowed to smoke one pipe of tobacco.</p>

<p>What a harmless request! How could the King refuse so
harmless a request?</p>

<p>"Yes," said his Majesty, "you may smoke one pipe of
tobacco."</p>

<p>The soldier took out his tinder-box, struck a match, once,
twice, thrice, and lo! there before him stood the three enormous
dogs, waiting his commands.</p>

<p>"Help me," shouted the soldier; "do not let me be hanged."</p>

<p>At once the three terrible dogs rushed at the judges and
councilors, tossed them high into the air, so that as they fell they
were broken into pieces.</p>

<p>The King began to speak; perhaps he was going to forgive the
soldier, but no one knows what he was going to say, for the biggest
dog gave him no time to finish his sentence.</p>

<p>He rushed at the King and Queen, flung them high into the
air, so that when they fell down, they too were broken all to
pieces.</p>

<p>Then the soldiers and the people, who were all terribly
frightened, shouted in a great hurry, "Brave soldier, you shall
be our King, and the beautiful Princess shall be our Queen!"</p>

<p>And while they led the soldier to the royal carriage the great
big dogs bounded along in front.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[page&nbsp;268]</span>
<p>
Little boys whistled gaily, and the guards presented arms.</p>

<p>Then the Princess was sent for, and made Queen, which she
liked much better than living shut up in a copper palace. And
the wedding feast lasted for eight whole days, and the three
monster wizard dogs sat at the table, staring around them with
all their eyes.</p>

<h2>BOOTS AND HIS BROTHERS</h2>


<h4>BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> on a time there was a man who had three sons, Peter,
Paul, and John. John was Boots, of course, because he was
the youngest. I can't say the man had anything more than
these three sons, for he had n't one penny to rub against another;
and so he told his sons over and over again they must go out
into the world and try to earn their bread, for there at home
there was nothing to be looked for but starving to death.</p>

<p>Now, near the man's cottage was the King's palace, and,
you must know, just against the King's windows a great oak
had sprung up, which was so stout and big that it took away
all the light from the King's palace. The King had said he
would give many, many dollars to the man who could fell the
oak, but no one was man enough for that, for as soon as ever
one chip of the oak's trunk flew off, two grew in its stead. A
well, too, the King would have dug, which was to hold water
for the whole year; for all his neighbors had wells, but he
hadn't any, and that he thought a shame. So the King said he
would give to any one who could dig him such a well as would
hold water for a whole year round, both money and goods;
but no one could do it, for the King's palace lay high, high up
on a hill, and they had dug only a few inches before they came
upon the living rock.</p>

<p>But as the King had set his heart on having these two
<span class="left"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[page&nbsp;269]</span>
things done, he had it given out far and wide, in all the churches
of his kingdom, that he who could fell the big oak in the King's
courtyard, and get him a well that would hold water the whole
year round, should have the Princess and half the kingdom.
Well, you may easily know there was many a man who came
to try his luck; but for all their hacking and hewing, and all
their digging and delving, it was no good. The oak got
bigger and stouter at every stroke, and the rock didn't get
softer, either. So one day those three brothers thought they'd
set off and try too, and their father hadn't a word against it;
for even if they didn't get the Princess and half the kingdom,
it might happen they might get a place somewhere with a good
master; and that was all he wanted. So when the brothers
said they thought of going to the palace, their father said
"yes" at once. So Peter, Paul, and Jack went off from their
home.</p>

<p>Well, they hadn't gone far before they came to a fir-wood,
and up along one side of it rose a steep hillside, and as they
went, they heard something hewing and hacking away up on
the hill among the trees.</p>

<p>"I wonder, now, what it is that is hewing away up yonder,"
said Jack.</p>

<p>"You're always so clever with your wonderings," said
Peter and Paul both at once. "What wonder is it, pray, that
a woodcutter should stand and hack up on a hillside?"</p>

<p>"Still, I'd like to see what it is, after all," said Jack; and
up he went.</p>

<p>"Oh, if you're such a child, 'twill do you good to go and
take a lesson," bawled out his brothers after him.</p>

<p>But Jack didn't care for what they said; he climbed the
steep hillside towards where the noise came, and when he
reached the place, what do you think he saw? Why, an axe
that stood there hacking and hewing, all of itself, at the trunk
of a fir.</p>

<p>"Good-day!" said Jack. "So you stand here all alone
and hew, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; here I've stood and hewed and hacked a long, long
time, waiting for you," said the Axe.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[page&nbsp;270]</span>
<p>
"Well, here I am at last," said Jack, as he took the axe,
pulled it off its handle, and stuffed both head and handle into
his wallet.</p>

<p>So when he got down again to his brothers, they began to
jeer and laugh at him.</p>

<p>"And now, what funny thing was it you saw up yonder on
the hillside?" they said.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was only an axe we heard," said Jack.</p>

<p>So when they had gone a bit farther, they came under a
steep spur of rock, and up there they heard something digging
and shoveling.</p>

<p>"I wonder now," said Jack, "what it is digging and shoveling
up yonder at the top of the rock."</p>

<p>"Ah, you're always so clever with your wonderings," said
Peter and Paul again; "as if you'd never heard a woodpecker
hacking and pecking at a hollow tree."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Jack, "I think it would be a piece of
fun just to see what it really is."</p>

<p>And so off he set to climb the rock, while the others laughed
and made game of him. But he didn't care a bit for that; up
he climbed, and when he got near the top, what do you think
he saw? Why, a spade that stood there digging and delving.</p>

<p>"Good-day!" said Jack. "So you stand here all alone,
and dig and delve!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what I do," said the Spade, "and that's what
I've done this many a long day, waiting for you."</p>

<p>"Well, here I am," said Jack again, as he took the spade
and knocked it off its handle, and put it into his wallet, and
then down again to his brothers.</p>

<p>"Well, what was it, so rare and strange," said Peter and
Paul, "that you saw up there at the top of the rock?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Jack, "nothing more than a spade; that was
what we heard."</p>

<p>So they went on again a good bit, till they came to a brook.
They were thirsty, all three, after their long walk, and so they
lay down beside the brook to have a drink.</p>

<p>"I wonder now," said Jack, "where all this water comes
from."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[page&nbsp;271]</span>
<p>
"I wonder if you're right in your head," said Peter and
Paul in one breath. "If you're not mad already, you'll go
mad very soon, with your wonderings. Where the brook comes
from, indeed! Have you never heard how water rises from a
spring in the earth?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but still I've a great fancy to see where this brook
comes from," said Jack.</p>

<p>So up alongside the brook he went, in spite of all that his
brothers bawled after him. Nothing could stop him. On
he went. So, as he went up and up, the brook got smaller and
smaller, and at last, a little way farther on, what do you think
he saw? Why, a great walnut, and out of that the water trickled.</p>

<p>"Good-day!" said Jack again; "So you lie here, and
trickle and run down all alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," said the Walnut; "and here have I trickled
and run this many a long day, waiting for you."</p>

<p>"Well, here I am," said Jack, as he took up a lump of moss,
and plugged up the hole, that the water mightn't run out. Then
he put the walnut into his wallet, and ran down to his brothers.</p>

<p>"Well, now," said Peter and Paul, "have you found out
where the water comes from? A rare sight it must have been!"</p>

<p>"Oh, after all, it was only a hole it ran out of," said Jack;
and so the others laughed and made game of him again, but
Jack didn't mind that a bit.</p>

<p>"After all, I had the fun of seeing it," said he.</p>

<p>So when they had gone a bit farther they came to the King's
palace; but as every one in the kingdom had heard how they
might win the Princess and half the realm, if they could only
fell the big oak and dig the King's well, so many had come to
try their luck that the oak was now twice as stout and big as it
had been at first, for two chips grew for every one they hewed
out with their axes, as I dare say you all bear in mind. So the
King had now laid it down as a punishment that if any one tried
and couldn't fell the oak, he should be put on a barren island,
and both his ears were to be clipped off. But the two brothers
didn't let themselves be scared by that; they were quite sure
they could fell the oak, and Peter, as he was eldest, was to try
his hand first; but it went with him as with all the rest who had
<span class="left"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[page&nbsp;272]</span>
hewn at the oak; for every chip he cut out, two grew in its place.
So the King's men seized him, and clipped off both his ears,
and put him out on the island.</p>

<p>Now Paul, he was to try his luck, but he fared just the
same; when he had hewn two or three strokes, they began to
see the oak grow, and so the King's men seized him too, and
clipped his ears, and put him out on the island; and his ears
they clipped closer, because they said he ought to have taken a
lesson from his brother.</p>

<p>So now Jack was to try.</p>

<p>"If you <i>will</i> look like a marked sheep, we're quite ready
to clip your ears at once, and then you'll save yourself some
bother," said the King, for he was angry with him for his
brothers' sake.</p>

<p>"Well, I'd like to just try first," said Jack, and so he got
leave. Then he took his axe out of his wallet and fitted it to
its handle.</p>

<p>"Hew away!" said he to his axe; and away it hewed, making
the chips fly again, so that it wasn't long before down came
the oak.</p>

<p>When that was done, Jack pulled out his spade, and fitted
it to its handle.</p>

<p>"Dig away!" said he to the spade; and so the spade began
to dig and delve till the earth and rock flew out in splinters,
and so he had the well soon dug out, you may think.</p>

<p>And when he had got it as big and deep as he chose, Jack
took out his walnut and laid it in one corner of the well, and
pulled the plug of moss out.</p>

<p>"Trickle and run," said Jack, and so the nut trickled and
ran, till the water gushed out of the hole in a stream, and in a
short time the well was brimful.</p>

<p>Then Jack had felled the oak which shaded the King's
palace, and dug a well in the palace-yard, and so he got the
Princess and half the kingdom, as the King had said; but it
was lucky for Peter and Paul that they had lost their ears,
else they had heard each hour and day how every one said,
"Well, after all, Jack wasn't so much out of his mind when he
took to wondering."</p>

<h2>THE HUSBAND WHO WAS TO MIND THE HOUSE</h2>


<h4>BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> on a time there was a man so surly and cross he never
thought his wife did anything right in the house. So one
evening, in haymaking time, he came home, scolding and
swearing, and showing his teeth and making a dust.</p>

<p>"Dear love, don't be so angry; there's a good man," said
his goody; "to-morrow let's change our work. I'll go out
with the mowers and mow, and you shall mind the house at
home."</p>

<p>Yes, the husband thought that would do very well. He
was quite willing, he said.</p>

<p>So, early next morning, his goody took a scythe over her
neck, and went out into the hayfield with the mowers and
began to mow; but the man was to mind the house, and do the
work at home.</p>

<p>First of all he wanted to churn the butter; but when he had
churned a while he got thirsty, and went down to the cellar to
tap a barrel of ale. So, just when he had knocked in the bung,
and was putting the tap into the cask, he heard overhead the
pig come into the kitchen. Then off he ran up the cellar steps,
with the tap in his hand, as fast as he could, to look after the
pig, lest it should upset the churn; but when he got up, and saw
the pig had already knocked the churn over, and stood there,
routing and grunting amongst the cream which was running
all over the floor, he got so wild with rage that he quite forgot
the ale-barrel, and ran at the pig as hard as he could. He
caught it, too, just as it ran out of doors, and gave it such a
kick that piggy lay for dead on the spot. Then all at once he
remembered he had the tap in his hand; but when he got down
to the cellar, every drop of ale had run out of the cask.</p>

<p>Then he went into the dairy and found enough cream left
to fill the churn again, and so he began to churn, for butter
they must have at dinner. When he had churned a bit, he
<span class="left"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[page&nbsp;274]</span>
remembered that their milking cow was still shut up in the
stable, and hadn't had a bit to eat or a drop to drink all the
morning, though the sun was high. Then all at once he thought
'twas too far to take her down to the meadow, so he'd just
get her up on the housetop&mdash;for the house, you must know,
was thatched with sods, and a fine crop of grass was growing
there. Now their house lay close up against a steep down, and
he thought if he laid a plank across to the thatch at the back
he'd easily get the cow up.</p>

<p>But still he couldn't leave the churn, for there was his
little babe crawling about on the floor, and "if I leave it," he
thought, "the child is sure to upset it." So he took the churn
on his back, and went out with it; but then he thought he'd
better first water the cow before he turned her out on the
thatch; so he took up a bucket to draw water out of the well;
but, as he stooped down at the well's brink, all the cream ran
out of the churn over his shoulders, and so down into the well.</p>

<p>Now it was near dinner-time, and he hadn't even got the
butter yet; so he thought he'd best boil the porridge, and filled
the pot with water, and hung it over the fire. When he had
done that, he thought the cow might perhaps fall off the thatch
and break her legs or her neck. So he got up on the house to
tie her up. One end of the rope he made fast to the cow's
neck, and the other he slipped down the chimney and tied
round his own thigh; and he had to make haste, for the water
now began to boil in the pot, and he had still to grind the oatmeal.</p>

<p>So he began to grind away; but while he was hard at it,
down fell the cow off the housetop after all, and as she fell
she dragged the man up the chimney, by the rope. There he
stuck fast; and as for the cow, she hung half-way down the wall,
swinging between heaven and earth, for she could neither get
down nor up.</p>

<p>And now the goody had waited seven lengths and seven
breadths for her husband to come and call them home to dinner;
but never a call they had. At last she thought she'd waited
long enough, and went home. But when she got there and
saw the cow hanging in such an ugly place, she ran up and cut
<span class="left"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[page&nbsp;275]</span>
the rope in two with her scythe. But as she did this, down
came her husband out of the chimney; and so when his old
dame came inside the kitchen, there she found him standing
on his head in the porridge-pot.</p>

<h2>BUTTERCUP</h2>

<h4>BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> on a time there was an old wife who sat and baked.
Now you must know that this old wife had a little son, who
was so plump and fat, and so fond of good things, that they
called him Buttercup; she had a dog, too, whose name was
Goldtooth, and as she was baking, all at once Goldtooth began
to bark.</p>

<p>"Run out, Buttercup, there's a dear!" said the old wife,
"and see what Goldtooth is barking at."</p>

<p>So the boy ran out, and came back crying out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven help us! here comes a great big witch, with
her head under her arm, and a bag at her back."</p>

<p>"Jump under the kneading-trough and hide yourself,"
said his mother.</p>

<p>So in came the old hag.</p>

<p>"Good day," said she.</p>

<p>"God bless you!" said Buttercup's mother.</p>

<p>"Isn't your Buttercup at home to-day?" asked the hag.</p>

<p>"No, that he isn't. He's out in the wood with his father,
shooting grouse."</p>

<p>"Plague take it," said the hag, "for I had such a nice little
silver knife I wanted to give him."</p>

<p>"Pip, pip! here I am," said Buttercup under the kneading-trough,
and out he came.</p>

<p>"I'm so old and stiff in the back," said the hag, "you must
creep into the bag and fetch it out for yourself."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[page&nbsp;276]</span>

<p>But when Buttercup was well into the bag, the hag threw
it over her back and strode off, and when they had gone a good
bit of the way, the old hag got tired and asked,</p>

<p>"How far is it off to Snoring?"</p>

<p>"Half a mile," answered Buttercup.</p>

<p>So the hag put down the sack on the road, and went aside
by herself into the wood, and lay down to sleep. Meantime
Buttercup set to work and cut a hole in the sack with his knife;
then he crept out and put a great root of a fir-tree into the sack,
and ran home to his mother.</p>

<p>When the hag got home and saw what there was in the sack,
you may fancy she was in a fine rage.</p>

<p>Next day the old wife sat and baked again, and her dog
began to bark, just as he did the day before.</p>

<p>"Run out, Buttercup, my boy," said she, "and see what
Goldtooth is barking at."</p>

<p>"Well, I never!" cried Buttercup, as soon as he got out;
"if there isn't that ugly old beast coming again with her head
under her arm and a great sack at her back."</p>

<p>"Under the kneading-trough with you and hide," said
his mother.</p>

<p>"Good day!" said the hag; "is your Buttercup at home
to-day?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to say he isn't," said his mother; "he's out in
the wood with his father, shooting grouse."</p>

<p>"What a bore!" said the hag; "here I have a beautiful
little silver spoon I want to give him."</p>

<p>"Pip, pip! here I am," said Buttercup, and crept out.</p>

<p>"I'm so stiff in the back," said the old witch, "you must
creep into the sack and fetch it out for yourself."</p>

<p>So when Buttercup was well into the sack, the hag swung
it over her shoulders and set off home as fast as her legs could
carry her. But when they had gone a good bit she grew weary,
and asked,</p>

<p>"How far is it off to Snoring?"</p>

<p>"A mile and a half," answered Buttercup.</p>

<p>So the hag set down the sack, and went aside into the wood
to sleep a bit, but while she slept Buttercup made a hole in the
<span class="left"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[page&nbsp;277]</span>
sack and got out, and put a great stone into it. Now, when
the old witch got home, she made a great fire on the hearth,
and put a big pot on it, and got everything ready to boil Buttercup;
but when she took the sack, and thought she was going
to turn out Buttercup into the pot, down plumped the stone
and made a hole in the bottom of the pot, so that the water ran
out and quenched the fire. Then the old hag was in a dreadful
rage, and said, "If he makes himself ever so heavy next time,
he shan't take me in again."</p>

<p>The third day everything went just as it had gone twice
before; Goldtooth began to bark, and Buttercup's mother
said to him,</p>

<p>"Do run out and see what our dog is barking at."</p>

<p>So out he went, but he soon came back crying out,</p>

<p>"Heaven save us! Here comes the old hag again with
her head under her arm and a sack at her back."</p>

<p>"Jump under the kneading-trough and hide," said his
mother.</p>

<p>"Good day!" said the hag, as she came in at the door;
"is your Buttercup at home to-day?"</p>

<p>"You're very kind to ask after him," said his mother;
"but he's out in the wood with his father, shooting grouse."</p>

<p>"What a bore, now," said the old hag; "here have I got
such a beautiful little silver fork for him."</p>

<p>"Pip, pip! here I am," said Buttercup, as he came out
from under the kneading-trough.</p>

<p>"I'm so stiff in the back," said the hag, "you must creep
into the sack and fetch it out for yourself."</p>

<p>But when Buttercup was well inside the sack the old hag
swung it across her shoulders, and set off as fast as she could.
This time she did not turn aside to sleep by the way, but went
straight home with Buttercup in the sack, and when she reached
her house it was Sunday.</p>

<p>So the old hag said to her daughter:</p>

<p>"Now you must take Buttercup and kill him, and boil
him nicely till I come back, for I'm off to church to bid my
guests to dinner."</p>

<p>So, when all in the house were gone to church, the daughter
<span class="left"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[page&nbsp;278]</span>
was to take Buttercup and kill him, but then she didn't know
how to set about it at all.</p>

<p>"Stop a bit," said Buttercup; "I'll soon show you how to
do it; just lay your head on the chopping-block, and you'll
soon see."</p>

<p>So the poor silly thing laid her head down, and Buttercup
took an axe and chopped her head off, just as if she had been
a chicken. Then he laid her head in the bed, and popped her
body into the pot, and boiled it so nicely; and when he had done
that, he climbed up on the roof, and dragged up with him
the fir-tree root and the stone, and put one over the door, and
the other at the top of the chimney.</p>

<p>So when the household came back from church, and saw
the head on the bed, they thought it was the daughter who lay
there asleep; and then they thought they would just taste the
broth.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Good, by my troth!</p>
<p>Buttercup broth,"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>said the old hag.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Good, by my troth!</p>
<p>Daughter broth,"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>said Buttercup down the chimney, but no one heeded him.</p>

<p>So the old hag's husband, who was every bit as bad as she,
took the spoon to have a taste.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Good, by my troth!</p>
<p>Buttercup broth,"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>said he.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Good, by my troth!</p>
<p>Daughter broth,"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>said Buttercup down the chimney pipe.</p>

<p>Then they all began to wonder who it could be that chattered
so, and ran out to see. But when they came out at the door,
Buttercup threw down on them the fir-tree root and the stone,
and broke all their heads to bits. After that he took all the
gold and silver that lay in the house, and went home to his
mother, and became a rich man.</p>

<h2>SEVEN AT ONE BLOW</h2>


<h4>BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">A</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>TAILOR</b> sat in his workroom one morning, stitching away
busily at a coat for the Lord Mayor. He whistled and sang
so gaily that all the little boys who passed the shop on their
way to school thought what a fine thing it was to be a tailor,
and told one another that when they grew to be men they'd
be tailors, too.</p>

<p>"How hungry I feel, to be sure!" cried the little man, at
last; "but I'm far too busy to trouble about eating. I must
finish his lordship's coat before I touch a morsel of food," and
he broke once more into a merry song.</p>

<p>"Fine new jam for sale," sang out an old woman, as she
walked along the street.</p>

<p>"Jam! I can't resist such a treat," said the tailor; and,
running to the door, he shouted, "This way for jam, dame;
show me a pot of your very finest."</p>

<p>The woman handed him jar after jar, but he found fault
with all. At last he hit upon some to his liking.</p>

<p>"And how many pounds will you take, sir?"</p>

<p>"I'll take four ounces," he replied, in a solemn tone, "and
mind you give me good weight."</p>

<p>The old woman was very angry, for she had expected to
sell several pounds, at least; and she went off grumbling, after
she had weighed out the four ounces.</p>

<p>"Now for a feed!" cried the little man, taking a loaf from
the cupboard as he spoke. He cut off a huge slice, and spread
the jam on quite half an inch thick; then he suddenly remembered
his work.</p>

<p>"It will never do to get jam on the Lord Mayor's coat, so
I'll finish it off before I take even one bite," said he. So he
picked up his work once more, and his needle flew in and out
like lightning.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[page&nbsp;280]</span>
<p>
I am afraid the Lord Mayor had some stitches in his garment
that were quite a quarter of an inch long.</p>

<p>The tailor glanced longingly at his slice of bread and jam
once or twice, but when he looked the third time it was quite
covered with flies, and a fine feast they were having off it.</p>

<p>This was too much for the little fellow. Up he jumped,
crying:</p>

<p>"So you think I provide bread and jam for you, indeed!
Well, we'll very soon see! Take that!" and he struck the
flies such a heavy blow with a duster that no fewer than seven
lay dead upon the table, while the others flew up to the ceiling
in great haste.</p>

<p>"Seven at one blow!" said the little man with great pride.
"Such a brave deed ought to be known all over the town,
and it won't be my fault if folks fail to hear of it."</p>

<p>So he cut out a wide belt, and stitched on it in big golden
letters the words "Seven at one blow." When this was done
he fastened it round him, crying:</p>

<p>"I'm cut out for something better than a tailor, it's quite
clear. I'm one of the world's great heroes, and I'll be off at
once to seek my fortune."</p>

<p>He glanced round the cottage, but there was nothing of
value to take with him. The only thing he possessed in the
world was a small cheese.</p>

<p>"You may as well come, too," said he, stowing away the
cheese in his pocket, "and now I'm off."</p>

<p>When he got into the street the neighbors all crowded round
him to read the words on his belt.</p>

<p>"Seven at one blow!" said they to one another. "What a
blessing he's going; for it wouldn't be safe to have a man about
us who could kill seven of us at one stroke."</p>

<p>You see, they didn't know that the tailor had only killed
flies; they took it to mean men.</p>

<p>He jogged along for some miles until he came to a hedge,
where a little bird was caught in the branches.</p>

<p>"Come along," said the tailor; "I'll have you to keep my
cheese company"; so he caught the bird and put it carefully
into his pocket with the cheese.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[page&nbsp;281]</span>
<p>
Soon he reached a lofty mountain, and he made up his mind
to climb it and see what was going on at the other side. When
he reached the top, there stood a huge giant, gazing down into
the valley below.</p>

<p>"Good day," said the tailor.</p>

<p>The giant turned round, and seeing nobody but the little
tailor there, he cried with scorn:</p>

<p>"And what might you be doing here, might I ask? You'd
best be off at once."</p>

<p>"Not so fast, my friend," said the little man; "read this."</p>

<p>"Seven at one blow," read the giant, and he began to wish
he'd been more civil.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure nobody would think it to look at you,"
he replied; "but since you are so clever, do this," and he picked
up a stone and squeezed it until water ran out.</p>

<p>"Do that! Why, it's mere child's play to me," and the man
took out his cheese and squeezed it until the whey ran from it.
"Now who is cleverer?" asked the tailor. "You see, I can
squeeze milk out, while you only get water."</p>

<p>The giant was too surprised to utter a word for a few minutes;
then, taking up another stone, he threw it so high into
the air that for a moment they couldn't see where it went;
then down it fell to the ground again.</p>

<p>"Good!" said the tailor; "but I'll throw a stone that won't
come back again at all."</p>

<p>Taking the little bird from his pocket, he threw it into the air,
and the bird, glad to get away, flew right off and never returned.</p>

<p>This sort of thing didn't suit the giant at all, for he wasn't
used to being beaten by any one.</p>

<p>"Here's something that you'll never manage," said he to
the little man. "Just come and help me to carry this fallen
oak-tree for a few miles."</p>

<p>"Delighted!" said the tailor, "and I'll take the end with
the branches, for it's sure to be heavier."</p>

<p>"Agreed," replied the giant, and he lifted the heavy trunk
on to his shoulder, while the tailor climbed up among the
branches at the other end, and sang with all his might, as though
carrying a tree was nothing to him.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[page&nbsp;282]</span>
<p>
The poor giant, who was holding the tree-trunk and the
little tailor as well, soon grew tired.</p>

<p>"I'm going to let it fall!" he shouted, and the tailor jumped
down from the branches, and pretended he had been helping
all the time.</p>

<p>"The idea of a man your size finding a tree too heavy to
carry!" laughed the little tailor.</p>

<p>"You are a clever little fellow, and no mistake," replied the
giant, "and if you'll only come and spend the night in our cave,
we shall be delighted to have you."</p>

<p>"I shall have great pleasure in coming, my friend," answered
the little tailor, and together they set off for the giant's
home.</p>

<p>There were seven more giants in the cave, and each one of
them was eating a roasted pig for his supper. They gave the
little man some food, and then showed him a bed in which he
might pass the night. It was so big that, after tossing about for
half an hour in it, the tailor thought he would be more comfortable
if he slept in the corner, so he crept out without being
noticed.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night the giant stole out of bed and went
up to the one where he thought the little man was fast asleep.
Taking a big bar of iron, he struck such a heavy blow at it that
he woke up all the other giants.</p>

<p>"Keep quiet, friends," said he. "I've just killed the little
scamp."</p>

<p>The tailor made his escape as soon as possible, and he journeyed
on for many miles, until he began to feel very tired, so he
lay down under a tree, and was soon fast asleep. When he
awoke, he found a big crowd of people standing round him. Up
walked one very wise-looking old man, who was really the King's
prime minister.</p>

<p>"Is it true that you have killed seven at one blow?" he asked</p>

<p>"It is a fact," answered the little tailor.</p>

<p>"Then come with me to the King, my friend, for he's been
searching for a brave man like you for some time past. You
are to be made captain of his army, and the King will give you a
fine house to live in."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[page&nbsp;283]</span>
<p>
"That I will," replied the little man. "It is just the sort of
thing that will suit me, and I'll come at once."</p>

<p>He hadn't been in the King's service long before every one
grew jealous of him. The soldiers were afraid that, if they
offended him, he would make short work of them all, while the
members of the King's household didn't fancy the idea of making
such a fuss over a stranger.</p>

<p>So the soldiers went in a body to the King and asked that another
captain should be put over them, for they were afraid of
this one.</p>

<p>The King didn't like to refuse, for fear they should all desert,
and yet he didn't dare get rid of the captain, in case such a
strong and brave man should try to have his revenge.</p>

<p>At last the King hit upon a plan. In some woods close by
there lived two giants, who were the terror of the country side;
they robbed all the travelers, and if any resistance was offered
they killed the men on the spot.</p>

<p>Sending for the little tailor, he said:</p>

<p>"Knowing you to be the bravest man in my kingdom, I want
to ask a favor of you. If you will kill these two giants, and bring
me back proof that they are dead, you shall marry the Princess,
my daughter, and have half my kingdom. You shall also take
one hundred men to help you, and you are to set off at once."</p>

<p>"A hundred men, your Majesty! Pray, what do I want with
a hundred men? If I can kill seven at one blow, I needn't be
afraid of two. I'll kill them fast enough, never fear."</p>

<p>The tailor chose ten strong men, and told them to await him
on the border of the wood, while he went on quite alone. He
could hear the giants snoring for quite half an hour before he
reached them, so he knew in which direction to go.</p>

<p>He found the pair fast asleep under a tree, so he filled his
pockets with stones and climbed up into the branches over their
heads. Then he began to pelt one of the giants with the missiles,
until after a few minutes one of the men awoke. Giving
the other a rough push, he cried:</p>

<p>"If you strike me like that again, I'll know the reason why."</p>

<p>"I didn't touch you," said the other giant crossly, and they
were soon fast asleep once more.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[page&nbsp;284]</span>
<p>
Then the tailor threw stones at the other man, and soon he
awoke as the first had done.</p>

<p>"What did you throw that at me for?" said he.</p>

<p>"You are dreaming," answered the other, "I didn't throw
anything."</p>

<p>No sooner were they fast asleep again, than the little man
began to pelt them afresh.</p>

<p>Up they both sprang, and seizing each other, they began to
fight in real earnest. Not content with using their fists, they
tore up huge trees by the roots, and beat each other until very
soon the pair lay dead on the ground.</p>

<p>Down climbed the little tailor, and taking his sword in his
hand he plunged it into each giant, and then went back to the
edge of the forest where the ten men were waiting for him.</p>

<p>"They are as dead as two door nails," shouted the little man.
"I don't say that I had an easy task, for they tore up trees by
their roots to try to protect themselves with, but, of course, it was
no good. What were two giants to a man who has slain seven
at one blow?"</p>

<p>But the men wouldn't believe it until they went into the forest
and saw the two dead bodies, lying each in a pool of blood, while
the ground was covered with uprooted trees.</p>

<p>Back they went to the King, but instead of handing over half
his kingdom, as he had promised, his Majesty told the little tailor
that there was still another brave deed for him to do before he
got the Princess for his bride.</p>

<p>"Just name it, then; I'm more than ready," was the man's
reply.</p>

<p>"You are to kill the famous unicorn that is running wild in
the forest and doing so much damage. When this is done you
shall have your reward at once."</p>

<p>"No trouble at all, your Majesty. I'll get rid of him in a
twinkling."</p>

<p>He made the ten men wait for him at the entrance to the wood
as they had done the first time, and taking a stout rope and a
saw he entered the forest alone.</p>

<p>Up came the unicorn, but just as it was about to rush at the
man he darted behind a big tree.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[page&nbsp;285]</span>
<p>
The unicorn dashed with such force against the tree that its
horn was caught quite fast and it was kept a prisoner.</p>

<p>Taking his rope, he tied it tightly round the animal, and, after
sawing off the horn, back he went to the palace, leading the unicorn
by his side.</p>

<p>But even then the King was not satisfied, and he made the little
tailor catch a wild boar that had been seen wandering in the
woods.</p>

<p>He took a party of huntsmen with him, but again he made
them wait on the outskirts of the forest while he went on by himself.</p>

<p>The wild boar made a dash at the little tailor; but the man
was too quick for it. He slipped into a little building close
by, with the animal at his heels. Then, catching sight of a
small window, he forced his way out into the forest again,
and while the boar, who was too big and clumsy to follow,
stood gazing at the spot where he had disappeared, the tailor
ran round and closed the door, keeping the animal quite secure
inside. Then he called the hunters, who shot the boar
and carried the body back to the palace.</p>

<p>This time the King was obliged to keep his promise; so the
little tailor became a Prince, and a grand wedding they had,
too.</p>

<p>When they had been married for about a couple of years,
the Princess once overheard her husband talking in his sleep.</p>

<p>"Boy, if you have put a patch on that waistcoat, take the
Lord Mayor's coat home at once, or I'll box your ears,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," cried the Princess, "to think that I've married
a common tailor! Whatever can I do to get rid of him?"</p>

<p>So she told her father the story, and the King said she need
not worry, for he would find a way out of the difficulty. She
was to leave the door open that night, and while the tailor was
sleeping, the King's servants should steal into the room, bind
the tailor, and take him away to be killed.</p>

<p>The Princess promised to see that everything was in readiness,
and she tripped about all day with a very light heart.</p>

<p>She little knew that one of the tailor's servants had overheard
<span class="left"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[page&nbsp;286]</span>
their cruel plot, and carried the news straight to his
master.</p>

<p>That night, when the Princess thought her husband was
sleeping fast, she crept to the door and opened it.</p>

<p>To her great terror, the tailor began to speak.</p>

<p>"Boy, take the Lord Mayor's coat home, or I'll box your
ears. Haven't I killed seven at one blow? Haven't I slain
two giants, a unicorn, and a wild boar? What do I care for
the men who are standing outside my door at this moment?"</p>

<p>At these words off flew the men as though they had been
shot from a gun, and no more attempts were ever made on his
life. So the Princess had to make the best of a bad job.</p>

<p>He lived on and when the old King died he ascended the
throne in his stead. So the brave little tailor became ruler over
the whole kingdom; and his motto throughout his whole life
was, "Seven at one blow."</p>

<h2>ONE EYE, TWO EYES, THREE EYES</h2>

<h4>BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HERE</b> was once a woman who had three daughters, of whom
the eldest was named "One Eye," because she had only one
eye in the middle of her forehead. The second had two eyes,
like other people, and she was called "Two Eyes." The youngest
had three eyes, two like her second sister, and one in the
middle of her forehead, like the eldest, and she bore the name
of "Three Eyes."</p>

<p>Now because little Two Eyes looked just like other people,
her mother and sisters could not endure her. They said to her,
"You are not better than common folks, with your two eyes;
you don't belong to us."</p>

<p>So they pushed her about, and threw all their old clothes to
her for her to wear, and gave her only the pieces that were left
to eat, and did everything that they could to make her miserable.
<span class="left"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[page&nbsp;287]</span>
It so happened that little Two Eyes was sent into the fields to
take care of the goats, and she was often very hungry, although
her sisters had as much as they liked to eat. So one day she
seated herself on a mound in the field, and began to weep and
cry so bitterly that two little rivulets flowed from her eyes.
Once, in the midst of her sorrow she looked up, and saw a
woman standing near her who said, "What are you weeping
for, little Two Eyes?"</p>

<p>"I cannot help weeping," she replied; "for because I have
two eyes, like other people, my mother and sisters cannot bear
me; they push me about from one corner to another and make
me wear their old clothes, and give me nothing to eat but what
is left, so that I am always hungry. To-day they gave me so
little that I am nearly starved."</p>

<p>"Dry up your tears, little Two Eyes," said the wise woman;
"I will tell you something to do which will prevent you from
ever being hungry again. You have only to say to your own
goat:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"'Little goat, if you're able,</p>
<p>Pray deck out my table,'</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>and immediately there will be a pretty little table before you
full of all sorts of good things for you to eat, as much as you
like. And when you have had enough, and you do not want
the table any more, you need only say:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"'Little goat, when you're able,</p>
<p>Remove my nice table,'</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>and it will vanish from your eyes."</p>

<p>Then the wise woman went away. "Now," thought little
Two Eyes, "I will try if what she says is true, for I am hungry,"
so she said:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Little goat, if you're able,</p>
<p>Come and deck my pretty table."</p>
  </div>  </div>

  <a name="page287a" id="page287a"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/0571.jpg"><img src="images/0571-317.jpg" width="317" height="450" alt="Two-Eyes, the Goat, and the'Magic Table." border="0" /></a><br /><br />
<p class="center"><b>Two-Eyes, the Goat, and the'Magic Table.</b></p>
</div>

<p>The words were scarcely spoken, when a beautiful little
table stood really before her; it had a white cloth and plates,
and knives and forks, and silver spoons, and such a delicious
dinner, smoking hot as if it had just come from the kitchen.
<span class="left"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[page&nbsp;288]</span>
Then little Two Eyes sat down and said the shortest grace she
knew&mdash;"Pray God be our guest for all time. Amen"&mdash;before
she allowed herself to taste anything. But oh, how
she did enjoy her dinner! and when she had finished, she said,
as the wise woman had taught her:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Little goat, when you're able,</p>
<p>Remove my nice table."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>In a moment, the table and everything upon it had disappeared.
"That is a pleasant way to keep house," said little Two Eyes,
and felt quite contented and happy. In the evening, when
she went home with the goat, she found an earthenware dish
with some scraps which her sisters had left for her, but she did
not touch them. The next morning she went away with the
goat, leaving them behind where they had been placed for her.
The first and second times that she did so, the sisters did not
notice it; but when they found it happened every day, they said
one to the other, "There is something strange about little Two
Eyes, she leaves her supper every day, and all that has been put
for her has been wasted; she must get food somewhere else."</p>

<p>So they determined to find out the truth, and they arranged
that when Two Eyes took her goat to the field, One Eye should
go with her to take particular notice of what she did, and discover
if anything was brought for her to eat and drink.</p>

<p>So when Two Eyes started with her goat, One Eye said to
her, "I am going with you to-day to see if the goat gets her
food properly while you are watching the rest."</p>

<p>But Two Eyes knew what she had in her mind. So she
drove the goat into the long grass, and said, "Come, One
Eye, let us sit down here and rest, and I will sing to you."</p>

<p>One Eye seated herself, and, not being accustomed to walk
so far, or to be out in the heat of the sun, she began to feel
tired, and as little Two Eyes kept on singing, she closed her one
eye and fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>When Two Eyes saw this, she knew that One Eye could
not betray her, so she said:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Little goat, if you are able,</p>
<p>Come and deck my pretty table."</p>
  </div>  </div>
<span class="left"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[page&nbsp;289]</span>
<p>
She seated herself when it appeared, and ate and drank
very quickly, and when she had finished she said:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Little goat, when you are able,</p>
<p>Come and clear away my table."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>It vanished in the twinkling of an eye; and then Two Eyes
woke up One Eye, and said: "Little One Eye, you are a clever
one to watch goats; for, while you are asleep, they might be
running all over the world. Come, let us go home!"</p>

<p>So they went to the house, and little Two Eyes again left
the scraps on the dish untouched, and One Eye could not tell
her mother whether little Two Eyes had eaten anything in the
field; for she said to excuse herself, "I was asleep."</p>

<p>The next day the mother said to Three Eyes, "You must go
to the field this time, and find out whether there is anyone who
brings food to little Two Eyes; for she must eat and drink
secretly."</p>

<p>So when little Two Eyes started with her goat, Three Eyes
followed and said, "I am going with you to-day, to see if the
goats are properly fed and watched."</p>

<p>But Two Eyes knew her thoughts; so she led the goat through
the long grass to tire Three Eyes, and at last she said, "Let us
sit down here and rest, and I will sing to you, Three Eyes."</p>

<p>She was glad to sit down, for the walk and the heat of the
sun had really tired her; and, as her sister continued her song,
she was obliged to close two of her eyes, and they slept, but not
the third. In fact, Three Eyes was wide awake with one eye,
and heard and saw all that Two Eyes did; for poor little Two
Eyes, thinking she was asleep, said her speech to the goat,
and the table came with all the good things on it, and was
carried away when Two Eyes had eaten enough; and the
cunning Three Eyes saw it all with her one eye. But she pretended
to be asleep when her sister came to wake her and told
her she was going home.</p>

<p>That evening, when little Two Eyes again left the supper
they placed aside for her, Three Eyes said to her mother, "I
know where the proud thing gets her good eating and drinking;"
and then she described all she had seen in the field. "I saw
<span class="left"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[page&nbsp;290]</span>
it all with one eye," she said; "for she had made my other two
eyes close with her fine singing, but luckily the one in my forehead
remained open."</p>

<p>Then the envious mother cried out to poor little Two
Eyes, "You wish to have better food than we, do you? You
shall lose your wish!" She took up a butcher's knife, went
out, and stuck the good little goat in the heart, and it fell dead.</p>

<p>When little Two Eyes saw this, she went out into the field,
seated herself on a mound, and wept most bitter tears.</p>

<p>Presently the wise woman stood again before her, and
said, "Little Two Eyes, why do you weep?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" she replied, "I must weep. The goat, who every
day spread my table so beautifully, has been killed by my
mother, and I shall have again to suffer from hunger and
sorrow."</p>

<p>"Little Two Eyes," said the wise woman, "I will give you
some good advice. Go home, and ask your sister to give you
the heart of the slaughtered goat, and then go and bury it in
the ground in front of the house-door."</p>

<p>On saying this the wise woman vanished.</p>

<p>Little Two Eyes went home quickly, and said to her sister,
"Dear sister, give me some part of my poor goat. I don't
want anything valuable; only give me the heart."</p>

<p>Her sister laughed, and said: "Of course you can have that
if you don't want anything else."</p>

<p>So little Two Eyes took the heart; and in the evening, when
all was quiet, buried it in the ground outside the house-door,
as the wise woman had told her to do.</p>

<p>The next morning, when they all rose and looked out of the
window, there stood a most wonderful tree, with leaves of silver
and apples of gold hanging between them. Nothing in the wide
world could be more beautiful or more costly. They none of
them knew how the tree could come there in one night, excepting
little Two Eyes. She supposed it had grown up from the heart
of the goat; for it stood over where she had buried it in the earth.</p>

<p>Then said the mother to little One Eye, "Climb up, my child,
and break off some of the fruit from the tree."</p>

<p>One Eye climbed up, but when she tried to catch a branch
<span class="left"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[page&nbsp;291]</span>
and pluck one of the apples, it escaped from her hand, and so it
happened every time she made the attempt, and, do what she
would, she could not reach one.</p>

<p>"Three Eyes," said the mother, "climb up, and try what you
can do; perhaps you will be able to see better with your three eyes
than One Eye can."</p>

<p>One Eye slid down from the tree, and Three Eyes climbed up.
But Three Eyes was not more skilful; with all her efforts she
could not draw the branches, nor the fruit, near enough to pluck
even a leaf, for they sprang back as she put out her hand.</p>

<p>At last the mother was impatient, and climbed up herself,
but with no more success, for, as she appeared to grasp a branch,
or fruit, her hand closed upon thin air.</p>

<p>"May I try?" said little Two Eyes; "perhaps I may succeed."</p>

<p>"You, indeed!" cried her sisters; "you, with your two eyes,
what can you do?"</p>

<p>But Two Eyes climbed up, and the golden apples did not fly
back from her when she touched them, but almost laid themselves
on her hand, and she plucked them one after another, till
she carried down her own little apron full.</p>

<p>The mother took them from her, and gave them to her sisters,
as she said little Two Eyes did not handle them properly, but
this was only from jealousy, because little Two Eyes was the
only one who could reach the fruit, and she went into the house
feeling more spiteful to her than ever.</p>

<p>It happened that while all three sisters were standing under
the tree together a young knight rode by. "Run away, quick,
and hide yourself, little Two Eyes; hide yourself somewhere, for
we shall be quite ashamed for you to be seen." Then they
pushed the poor girl, in great haste, under an empty cask, which
stood near the tree, and several of the golden apples that she had
plucked along with her.</p>

<p>As the knight came nearer they saw he was a handsome man;
and presently he halted, and looked with wonder and pleasure at
the beautiful tree with its silver leaves and golden fruit.</p>

<p>At last he spoke to the sisters, and asked: "To whom does
this beautiful tree belong? If a man possessed only one branch
he might obtain all he wished for in the world."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[page&nbsp;292]</span>
<p>
"This tree belongs to us," said the two sisters, "and we will
break off a branch for you if you like." They gave themselves
a great deal of trouble in trying to do as they offered; but all to no
purpose, for the branches and the fruit evaded their efforts, and
sprung back at every touch.</p>

<p>"This is wonderful," exclaimed the knight, "that the tree
should belong to you, and yet you are not able to gather even a
branch."</p>

<p>They persisted, however, in declaring that the tree was their
own property. At this moment little Two Eyes, who was angry
because her sisters had not told the truth, caused two of the
golden apples to slip out from under the cask, and they rolled on
till they reached the feet of the knight's horse. When he saw
them, he asked in astonishment where they came from.</p>

<p>The two ugly maidens replied that they had another sister,
but they dared not let him see her, for she had only two eyes,
like common people, and was named little Two Eyes.</p>

<p>But the knight felt very anxious to see her, and called out,
"Little Two Eyes, come here." Then came Two Eyes, quite
comforted, from the empty cask, and the knight was astonished
to find her so beautiful.</p>

<p>Then he said: "Little Two Eyes, can you break off a branch
of the tree for me?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," she replied, "I can, very easily, for the tree belongs
to me." And she climbed up, and, without any trouble,
broke off a branch with its silver leaves and golden fruit and
gave it to the knight.</p>

<p>He looked down at her as she stood by his horse, and said:
"Little Two Eyes, what shall I give you for this?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" she answered, "I suffer from hunger and thirst, and
sorrow, and trouble, from early morning till late at night; if you
would only take me with you, and release me, I should be so
happy."</p>

<p>Then the knight lifted the little maiden on his horse, and
rode home with her to his father's castle. There she was given
beautiful clothes to wear, and as much to eat and drink as she
wished, and as she grew up the young knight loved her so dearly
that they were married with great rejoicings.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[page&nbsp;293]</span>

<p>Now, when the two sisters saw little Two Eyes carried away
by the handsome young knight, they were overjoyed at their
good fortune. "The wonderful tree belongs to us now," they
said; "even if we cannot break off a branch, yet everybody who
passes will stop to admire it, and make acquaintance with us,
and, who knows? we may get husbands after all."</p>

<p>But when they rose the next morning, lo! the tree had vanished,
and with it all their hopes. And on this very morning,
when little Two Eyes looked out of her chamber window of the
castle, she saw, to her great joy, that the tree had followed her.</p>

<p>Little Two Eyes lived for a long time in great happiness; but
she heard nothing of her sisters, till one day two poor women
came to the castle, to beg for alms. Little Two Eyes saw them,
and, looking earnestly in their faces, she recognized her two
sisters, who had become so poor that they were obliged to beg
their bread from door to door.</p>

<p>But the good sister received them most kindly, and promised
to take care of them and give them all they wanted. And then
they did indeed repent and feel sorry for having treated her so
badly in their youthful days.</p>

<h2>THE MUSICIANS OF BREMEN</h2>

<h4>BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">A</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>CERTAIN</b> man had a donkey that had served him faithfully
for many long years, but whose strength was so far gone
that at last he was quite unfit for work. So his master began to
consider how much he could make of the donkey's skin, but
the beast, perceiving that no good wind was blowing, ran away
along the road to Bremen. "There," thought he, "I can be
town musician." When he had run some way, he found a
hound lying by the roadside, yawning like one who was very
tired. "What are you yawning for now, you big fellow?"
asked the ass.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[page&nbsp;294]</span>
<p>
"Ah," replied the hound, "because every day I grow older
and weaker; I cannot go any more to the hunt, and my master
has well-nigh beaten me to death, so that I took to flight; and
now I do not know how to earn my bread."</p>

<p>"Well, do you know," said the ass, "I am going to Bremen,
to be town musician there; suppose you go with me and take
a share in the music. I will play on the lute, and you shall
beat the kettledrums." The dog was satisfied, and off they
set.</p>

<p>Presently they came to a cat, sitting in the middle of the
path, with a face like three rainy days! "Now, then, old
shaver, what has crossed you?" asked the ass.</p>

<p>"How can one be merry when one's neck has been pinched
like mine?" answered the cat. "Because I am growing old,
and my teeth are all worn to stumps, and because I would
rather sit by the fire and spin, than run after mice, my mistress
wanted to drown me; and so I ran away. But now good advice
is dear, and I do not know what to do."</p>

<p>"Go with us to Bremen. You understand nocturnal
music, so you can be town musician." The cat consented,
and went with them. The three vagabonds soon came near a
farmyard, where, upon the barn door, the cock was sitting
crowing with all his might. "You crow through marrow and
bone," said the ass; "what do you do that for?"</p>

<p>"That is the way I prophesy fine weather," said the cock;
"but because grand guests are coming for the Sunday, the
housewife has no pity, and has told the cook-maid to make me
into soup for the morrow; and this evening my head will be
cut off. Now I am crowing with a full throat as long as I can."</p>

<p>"Ah, but you, Red-comb," replied the ass, "rather come
away with us. We are going to Bremen, to find there something
better than death; you have a good voice, and if we make
music together it will have full play."</p>

<p>The cock consented to this plan, and so all four traveled on
together. They could not, however, reach Bremen in one day,
and at evening they came into a forest, where they meant to pass
the night. The ass and the dog laid themselves down under a
large tree, the cat and the cock climbed up into the branches,
<span class="left"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[page&nbsp;295]</span>
but the latter flew right to the top, where he was most safe.
Before he went to sleep he looked all round the four quarters,
and soon thought he saw a little spark in the distance; so,
calling his companions, he said they were not far from a house,
for he saw a light. The ass said: "If it is so, we had better
get up and go farther, for the pasturage here is very bad";
and the dog continued: "Yes, indeed! a couple of bones with
some meat on would be very acceptable!" So they made haste
toward the spot where the light was, and which shone now
brighter and brighter, until they came to a well-lighted robber's
cottage. The ass, as the biggest, went to the window and peeped
in. "What do you see, Gray-horse?" asked the cock. "What
do I see?" replied the ass; "a table laid out with savory meats
and drinks, with robbers sitting around enjoying themselves."</p>

<p>"That would be the right sort of thing for us," said the cock.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I wish we were there," replied the ass. Then
these animals took counsel together how they should contrive
to drive away the robbers, and at last they thought of a way.
The ass placed his forefeet upon the window ledge, the hound
got on his back, the cat climbed up upon the dog, and, lastly,
the cock flew up and perched upon the head of the cat. When
this was accomplished, at a given signal they commenced together
to perform their music: the ass brayed, the dog barked,
the cat mewed, and the cock crew; and they made such a tremendous
noise, and so loud, that the panes of the window were
shivered! Terrified at these unearthly sounds, the robbers
got up with great precipitation, thinking nothing less than that
some spirits had come, and fled off into the forest, so the four
companions immediately sat down at the table, and quickly
ate up all that was left, as if they had been fasting for six weeks.</p>

<p>As soon as they had finished, they extinguished the light,
and each sought for himself a sleeping-place, according to his
nature and custom. The ass laid himself down upon some
straw, the hound behind the door, the cat upon the hearth, near
the warm ashes, and the cock flew up on a beam which ran
across the room. Weary with their long walk, they soon went
to sleep.</p>

<p>At midnight the robbers perceived from their retreat that no
<span class="left"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[page&nbsp;296]</span>
light was burning in their house, and all appeared quiet; so
the captain said: "We need not have been frightened into
fits"; and, calling one of the band, he sent him forward to reconnoiter.
The messenger, finding all still, went into the
kitchen to strike a light, and, taking the glistening, fiery eyes of
the cat for live coals, he held a lucifer match to them, expecting
it to take fire. But the cat, not understanding the joke, flew
in his face, spitting and scratching, which dreadfully frightened
him, so that he made for the back door; but the dog, who laid
there, sprang up and bit his leg; and as he limped upon the
straw where the ass was stretched out, it gave him a powerful
kick with its hind foot. This was not all, for the cock, awaking
at the noise, clapped his wings, and cried from the beam:
"Cock-a-doodle-doo, cock-a-doodle-do!"</p>

<p>Then the robber ran back as well as he could to his captain,
and said: "Ah, my master, there dwells a horrible witch in the
house, who spat on me and scratched my face with her long
nails; and then before the door stands a man with a knife, who
chopped at my leg; and in the yard there lies a black monster,
who beat me with a great wooden club; and besides all, upon
the roof sits a judge, who called out, 'Bring the knave up, do!'
so I ran away as fast as I could."</p>

<p>After this the robbers dared not again go near their house;
but everything prospered so well with the four town musicians
of Bremen, that they did not forsake their situation! And there
they are to this day, for anything I know.</p>

<h2>THE FISHERMAN AND HIS WIFE</h2>

<h4>BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HERE</b> was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a
miserable little hovel close to the sea. He went to fish every
day, and he fished and fished, and at last one day, when he was
<span class="left"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[page&nbsp;297]</span>
sitting looking deep down into the shining water, he felt something
on his line. When he hauled it up there was a great flounder on
the end of the line. The flounder said to him: "Look here,
fisherman, don't you kill me; I am no common flounder, I am
an enchanted prince! What good will it do you to kill me? I
sha'n't be good to eat; put me back into the water, and leave me
to swim about."</p>

<p>"Well," said the fisherman, "you need not make so many
words about it. I am quite ready to put back a flounder that
can talk." And so saying, he put back the flounder into the
shining water, and it sank down to the bottom, leaving a streak
of blood behind it.</p>

<p>Then the fisherman got up and went back to his wife in the
hovel. "Husband," she said, "hast thou caught nothing to-day?"</p>

<p>"No," said the man; "all I caught was one flounder, and
he said he was an enchanted prince, so I let him go swim again."</p>

<p>"Didst thou not wish for anything then?" asked the good
wife.</p>

<p>"No," said the man; "what was there to wish for?"</p>

<p>"Alas!" said his wife; "isn't it bad enough always to live
in this wretched hovel? Thou mightest at least have wished for
a nice clean cottage. Go back and call him; tell him I want a
pretty cottage; he will surely give us that!"</p>

<p>"Alas," said the man, "what am I to go back there for?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the woman, "it was thou who caught him and
let him go again; for certain he will do that for thee. Be off
now!"</p>

<p>The man was still not very willing to go, but he did not want
to vex his wife, and at last he went back to the sea.</p>

<p>He found the sea no longer bright and shining, but dull and
green. He stood by it and said:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Flounder, flounder in the sea,</p>
<p>Prythee, hearken unto me:</p>
<p>My wife, Ilsebil, will have her own way</p>
<p>Whatever I wish, whatever I say."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The flounder came swimming up, and said: "Well, what do
you want?"</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[page&nbsp;298]</span>

<p>"Alas!" said the man; "I had to call you, for my wife said
I ought to have wished for something, as I caught you. She
doesn't want to live in our miserable hovel any longer; she wants
a pretty cottage."</p>

<p>"Go home again, then," said the flounder; "she has her
wish fully."</p>

<p>The man went home and found his wife no longer in the old
hut, but a pretty little cottage stood in its place, and his wife was
sitting on a bench by the door.</p>

<p>She took him by the hand, and said: "Come and look in
here&mdash;isn't this much better?"</p>

<p>They went inside and found a pretty sitting-room, and a
bedroom with a bed in it, a kitchen, and a larder furnished with
everything of the best in tin and brass, and every possible requisite.
Outside there was a little yard with chickens and
ducks, and a little garden full of vegetables and fruit.</p>

<p>"Look!" said the woman, "is not this nice?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the man; "and so let it remain. We can live
here very happily."</p>

<p>"We will see about that," said the woman, and with that
they ate something and went to bed.</p>

<p>Everything went well for a week or more, and then said the
wife: "Listen, husband; this cottage is too cramped, and the
garden is too small. The flounder might have given us a bigger
house. I want to live in a big stone castle. Go to the flounder,
and tell him to give us a castle."</p>

<p>"Alas, wife!" said the man; "the cottage is good enough for
us; what should we do with a castle?"</p>

<p>"Never mind," said his wife; "do thou but go to the flounder,
and he will manage it."</p>

<p>"Nay, wife," said the man; "the flounder gave us the cottage.
I don't want to go back; as likely as not he'll be angry."</p>

<p>"Go, all the same," said the woman. "He can do it easily
enough, and willingly into the bargain. Just go!"</p>

<p>The man's heart was heavy, and he was very unwilling to go.
He said to himself: "It's not right." But at last he went.</p>

<p>He found the sea was no longer green; it was still calm, but
dark violet and gray. He stood by it and said:</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[page&nbsp;299]</span>
<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Flounder, flounder in the sea,</p>
<p>Prythee, hearken unto me:</p>
<p>My wife, Ilsebil, will have her own way</p>
<p>Whatever I wish, whatever I say."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>"Now, what do you want?" said the flounder.</p>

<p>"Alas," said the man, half scared, "my wife wants a big
stone castle."</p>

<p>"Go home again," said the flounder; "she is standing at the
door of it."</p>

<p>Then the man went away, thinking he would find no house,
but when he got back he found a great stone palace, and his wife
standing at the top of the steps, waiting to go in.</p>

<p>She took him by the hand and said, "Come in with
me."</p>

<p>With that they went in and found a great hall paved with
marble slabs, and numbers of servants in attendance, who
opened the great doors for them. The walls were hung with
beautiful tapestries, and the rooms were furnished with golden
chairs and tables, while rich carpets covered the floors, and
crystal chandeliers hung from the ceilings. The tables groaned
under every kind of delicate food and the most costly wines.
Outside the house there was a great courtyard, with stabling
for horses, and cows, and many fine carriages. Beyond this
there was a great garden filled with the loveliest flowers, and
fine fruit trees. There was also a park, half a mile long, and in
it were stags and hinds, and hares, and everything of the kind
one could wish for.</p>

<p>"Now," said the woman, "is not this worth having?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said the man; "and so let it remain. We will
live in this beautiful palace and be content."</p>

<p>"We will think about that," said his wife, "and sleep upon
it."</p>

<p>With that they went to bed.</p>

<p>Next morning the wife woke up first; day was just dawning,
and from her bed she could see the beautiful country around her.
Her husband was still asleep, but she pushed him with her elbow,
and said, "Husband, get up and peep out of the window. See
here, now, could we not be king over all this land? Go to the
flounder. We will be king."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[page&nbsp;300]</span>
<p>
"Alas, wife," said the man, "what should we be king for?
I don't want to be king."</p>

<p>"Ah," said his wife, "if thou wilt not be king, I will. Go
to the flounder. I will be king."</p>

<p>"Alas, wife," said the man, "whatever dost thou want to be
king for? I don't like to tell him."</p>

<p>"Why not?" said the woman. "Go thou must. I will be
king."</p>

<p>So the man went; but he was quite sad because his wife
would be king.</p>

<p>"It is not right," he said; "it is not right."</p>

<p>When he reached the sea, he found it dark, gray, and rough,
and evil-smelling. He stood there and said:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Flounder, flounder in the sea,</p>
<p>Prythee, hearken unto me:</p>
<p>My wife, Ilsebil, will have her own way</p>
<p>Whatever I wish, whatever I say."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>"Now, what does she want?" said the flounder.</p>

<p>"Alas," said the man, "she wants to be king now."</p>

<p>"Go back. She is king already," said the flounder.</p>

<p>So the man went back, and when he reached the palace he
found that it had grown much larger, and a great tower had been
added, with handsome decorations. There was a sentry at the
door, and numbers of soldiers were playing drums and trumpets.
As soon as he got inside the house, he found everything was
marble and gold; and the hangings were of velvet, with great
golden tassels. The doors of the saloon were thrown wide open
and he saw the whole court assembled. His wife was sitting on a
lofty throne of gold and diamonds; she wore a golden crown, and
carried in one hand a scepter of pure gold. On each side of her
stood her ladies in a long row, each one a head shorter than the
next.</p>

<p>He stood before her, and said, "Alas, wife, art thou now
king?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said; "now I am king."</p>

<p>He stood looking at her for some time, and then he said,
"Ah, wife, it is a fine thing for thee to be king; now we will not
wish to be anything more."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[page&nbsp;301]</span>
<p>
"Nay, husband," she answered, quite uneasily, "I find the
time hangs very heavy on my hands. I can't bear it any longer.
Go back to the flounder. King I am, but I must also be emperor."</p>

<p>"Alas, wife," said the man, "why dost thou now want to be
emperor?"</p>

<p>"Husband," she answered, "go to the flounder. Emperor
I will be."</p>

<p>"Alas, wife," said the man, "emperor he can't make thee,
and I won't ask him. There is only one emperor in the country;
and emperor the flounder cannot make thee, that he can't."</p>

<p>"What?" said the woman. "I am king, and thou art but
my husband. To him thou must go, and that right quickly. If
he can make a king, he can also make an emperor. Emperor
I will be, so quickly go."</p>

<p>He had to go, but he was quite frightened. And as he went,
he thought, "This won't end well; emperor is too shameless.
The flounder will make an end of the whole thing."</p>

<p>With that he came to the sea, but now he found it quite black,
and heaving up from below in great waves. It tossed to and
fro, and a sharp wind blew over it, and the man trembled. So
he stood there, and said:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Flounder, flounder in the sea,</p>
<p>Prythee, hearken unto me:</p>
<p>My wife, Ilsebil, will have her own way</p>
<p>Whatever I wish, whatever I say."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>"What does she want now?" said the flounder.</p>

<p>"Alas, flounder," he said, "my wife wants to be emperor."</p>

<p>"Go back," said the flounder. "She is emperor."</p>

<p>So the man went back, and when he got to the door, he found
that the whole palace was made of polished marble, with alabaster
figures and golden decorations. Soldiers marched up and
down before the doors, blowing their trumpets and beating their
drums. Inside the palace, counts, barons, and dukes walked
about as attendants, and they opened to him the doors, which
were of pure gold.</p>

<p>He went in, and saw his wife sitting on a huge throne made
of solid gold. It was at least two miles high. She had on her
<span class="left"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[page&nbsp;302]</span>
head a great golden crown, set with diamonds, three yards high.
In one hand she held the scepter, and in the other the ball of
empire. On each side of her stood the gentlemen-at-arms in
two rows, each one a little smaller than the other, from giants
two miles high, down to the tiniest dwarf no bigger than my
little finger. She was surrounded by princes and dukes.</p>

<p>Her husband stood still, and said, "Wife, art thou now emperor?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said she; "now I am emperor."</p>

<p>Then he looked at her for some time, and said, "Alas, wife,
how much better off art thou for being emperor?"</p>

<p>"Husband," she said, "what art thou standing there for?
Now I am emperor, I mean to be pope! Go back to the flounder."</p>

<p>"Alas, wife," said the man, "what wilt thou not want?
Pope thou canst not be. There is only one pope in Christendom.
That's more than the flounder can do."</p>

<p>"Husband," she said, "pope I will be; so go at once. I
must be pope this very day."</p>

<p>"No, wife," he said, "I dare not tell him. It's no good; it's too
monstrous altogether. The flounder cannot make thee pope."</p>

<p>"Husband," said the woman, "don't talk nonsense. If he
can make an emperor, he can make a pope. Go immediately.
I am emperor, and thou art but my husband, and thou must
obey."</p>

<p>So he was frightened, and went; but he was quite dazed. He
shivered and shook, and his knees trembled.</p>

<p>A great wind arose over the land, the clouds flew across the
sky, and it grew as dark as night; the leaves fell from the trees,
and the water foamed and dashed upon the shore. In the distance
the ships were being tossed to and fro on the waves, and he
heard them firing signals of distress. There was still a little
patch of blue in the sky among the dark clouds, but toward the
south they were red and heavy, as in a bad storm. In despair,
he stood and said;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Flounder, flounder in the sea,</p>
<p>Prythee, hearken unto me:</p>
<p>My wife, Ilsebil, will have her own way</p>
<p>Whatever I wish, whatever I say."</p>
  </div>  </div>
<span class="left"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[page&nbsp;303]</span>
<p>
"Now, what does she want?" said the flounder.</p>

<p>"Alas" said the man, "she wants to be pope."</p>

<p>"Go back. Pope she is," said the flounder.</p>

<p>So back he went, and he found a great church, surrounded
with palaces. He pressed through the crowd, and inside he
found thousands and thousand of lights, and his wife, entirely
clad in gold, was sitting on a still higher throne, with three golden
crowns upon her head, and she was surrounded with priestly
state. On each side of her were two rows of candles, the biggest
as thick as a tower, down to the tiniest little taper. Kings
and emperors were on their knees before her, kissing her
shoe.</p>

<p>"Wife," said the man, looking at her, "art thou now pope?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said she; "now I am pope."</p>

<p>So there he stood gazing at her, and it was like looking at
a shining sun.</p>

<p>"Alas, wife," he said, "art thou better off for being pope?"
At first she sat as stiff as a post, without stirring. Then he
said, "Now, wife, be content with being pope; higher thou
canst not go."</p>

<p>"I will think about that," said the woman, and with that
they both went to bed. Still she was not content, and could not
sleep for her inordinate desires. The man slept well and
soundly, for he had walked about a great deal in the day; but
his wife could think of nothing but what further grandeur she
could demand. When the dawn reddened the sky, she raised
herself up in bed and looked out of the window, and when she
saw the sun rise she said:</p>

<p>"Ha! can I not cause the sun and the moon to rise? Husband!"
she cried, digging her elbow into his side, "wake up
and go to the flounder. I will be lord of the universe."</p>

<p>Her husband, who was still more than half asleep, was so
shocked that he fell out of bed. He thought he must have
heard wrong. He rubbed his eyes and said:</p>

<p>"Alas, wife, what didst thou say?"</p>

<p>"Husband," she said, "if I cannot be lord of the universe,
and cause the sun and moon to set and rise, I shall not be able
to bear it. I shall never have another happy moment."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[page&nbsp;304]</span>
<p>
She looked at him so wildly that it caused a shudder to run
through him.</p>

<p>"Alas, wife," he said, falling on his knees before her, "the
flounder can't do that. Emperor and pope he can make, but
that is indeed beyond him. I pray thee, control thyself and
remain pope."</p>

<p>Then she flew into a terrible rage. Her hair stood on end;
she panted for breath, and screamed:</p>

<p>"I won't bear it any longer; wilt thou go?"</p>

<p>Then he pulled on his trousers and tore away like a madman.
Such a storm was raging that he could hardly keep
his feet; houses and trees quivered and swayed, mountains
trembled, and the rocks rolled into the sea. The sky was
pitchy black; it thundered and lightened, and the sea ran in
black waves, mountains high, crested with white foam. He
shrieked out, but could hardly make himself heard:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Flounder, flounder in the sea,</p>
<p>Prythee, hearken unto me:</p>
<p>My wife, Ilsebil, will have her own way</p>
<p>Whatever I wish, whatever I say."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>"Now, what does she want?" asked the flounder.</p>

<p>"Alas," he said, "she wants to be Lord of the Universe."</p>

<p>"Now she must go back to her old hovel," said the flounder;
"and there you will find her."</p>

<p>And there they are to this very day!</p>

<h2>LITTLE SNOW-WHITE</h2>

<h4>BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> upon a time it was the middle of winter; the flakes of
snow were falling like feathers from the sky; a Queen sat
at a window sewing, and the frame of the window was made of
black ebony. As she was sewing and looking out of the window
<span class="left"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[page&nbsp;305]</span>
at the snow, she pricked her finger with the needle, and three
drops of blood fell upon the snow. And the red looked pretty
upon the white snow, and she thought to herself:</p>

<p>"Would that I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood,
and as black as the wood of the window-frame!" Soon after
that she had a little daughter, who was as white as snow, and
as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony; so she was
called Little Snow-white. And when the child was born, the
Queen died.</p>

<p>A year after, the King took to himself another wife. She
was beautiful but proud, and she could not bear to have any
one else more beautiful. She had a wonderful Looking-glass,
and when she stood in front of it, and looked at herself in it,
and said:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,</p>
<p>Who in this land is the fairest of all?"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>the Looking-glass answered:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Thou, O Queen, art the fairest of all!"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>At last she was well pleased, for she knew the Looking-glass
spoke the truth.</p>

<p>Now Snow-white grew up, and became more and more
beautiful; and when she was seven years old she was as beautiful
as the day, and more beautiful than the Queen herself.
And once when the queen asked her Looking-glass:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,</p>
<p>Who in this land is the fairest of all?"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>it answered:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Thou art fairer than all who are here, Lady Queen,</p>
<p>But more beautiful by far is Snow-white, I ween."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Then the Queen was angry, and turned green with envy.
From that hour, whenever she looked at Snow-white, her breath
came and went, she hated the girl so much.</p>

<p>And envy grew higher and higher in her heart like a weed,
so that she had no peace day or night. She called a huntsman,
and said:</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>[page&nbsp;306]</span>
<p>
"Take the child away into the wood; I will no longer have
her in my sight. Kill her, and bring me back her heart as a
token." The huntsman did as he was told, and took her away;
but when he had drawn his knife, and was about to pierce Snow-white's
little heart, she began to weep, and said:</p>

<p>"Ah, dear huntsman, leave me my life! I will run away into
the wild wood, and never come home again."</p>

<p>And as she was so beautiful the huntsman had pity on her
and said:</p>

<p>"Run away, then, you poor child." The wild beasts will soon
kill her, thought he; and yet it seemed as if a stone had been
rolled from his heart, since it was no longer needful for him to
kill her. As a young boar just then came running by he
stabbed it, and cut out its heart and took it to the Queen as a
proof that the child was dead. The cook had to salt this, and
the wicked Queen ate it, and thought she had eaten the heart of
Snow-white.</p>

<p>But now the poor child was all alone in the great wood, and
so afraid that she started at every bush, and did not know what
to do. Then she began to run, and ran over sharp stones and
through thorns, and the wild beasts ran past her, but did her no
harm.</p>

<p>She ran as long as her feet would go, until it was almost evening;
then she saw a little cottage, and went into it to rest herself.
Everything in the cottage was small, but neater and cleaner than
can be told. There was a table on which was a white cover, and
seven little plates, and by each plate was a little spoon; there
were seven little knives and forks, and seven little mugs. Against
the wall stood seven little beds side by side, covered with snow-white
coverlets.</p>

<p>Little Snow-white was so hungry and thirsty that she ate
some fruit and bread from each plate, and drank a drop of milk
out of each mug, for she did not wish to take all from one only.
Then, as she was so tired, she lay down on one of the little beds,
but none of them suited her; one was too long, another too short;
but at last she found the seventh one was just right, and so she
stayed in it, said her prayers, and went to sleep.</p>

<p>When it was quite dark the owners of the cottage came back;
<span class="left"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[page&nbsp;307]</span>
they were seven dwarfs who dug in the hills for gold. They lit
their seven candles, and as it was now light within the cottage
they could see that some one had been there, for everything was
not in the same order in which they had left it.</p>

<p>The first said, "Who has been sitting on my chair?"</p>

<p>The second, "Who has been eating off my plate?"</p>

<p>The third, "Who has been taking some of my bread?"</p>

<p>The fourth, "Who has been eating my fruit?"</p>

<p>The fifth, "Who has been using my fork?"</p>

<p>The sixth, "Who has been cutting with my knife?"</p>

<p>The seventh, "Who has been drinking out of my mug?"</p>

<p>Then the first looked round and saw that there was a little
hole in his bed, and he said:</p>

<p>"Who has been getting into my bed?" The others came up
and each called out:</p>

<p>"Somebody has been lying in my bed too." But the seventh,
when he looked at his bed, saw little Snow-white, who was lying
asleep there. And he called the others, who came running up,
and they cried out with wonder, and brought their seven little
candles and let the light fall on little Snow-white.</p>

<p>"Oh, heavens! oh, heavens!" cried they, "what a lovely
child!" and they were so glad that they did not wake her, but
let her sleep on in the bed. And the seventh dwarf slept with
the others, one hour with each, and so got through the night.</p>

<p>When it was morning little Snow-white awoke, and was
afraid when she saw the seven dwarfs. But they were friendly
and asked her what her name was.</p>

<p>"My name is Snow-white," she answered.</p>

<p>"How have you come to our house?" said the dwarfs.
Then she told them that the Queen had wished to have her killed,
but that the huntsman had spared her life; she had run for the
whole day, until at last she had found their house. The dwarfs
said:</p>

<p>"If you will take care of our house, cook, make the beds,
wash, sew, and knit; and if you will keep everything neat and
clean, you can stay with us, and you shall want for nothing."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Snow-white, "with all my heart," and she
stayed with them. She kept the house in order for them; in
<span class="left"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>[page&nbsp;308]</span>
the mornings they went to the hills and looked for gold; in the
evenings they came back, and then their supper had to be ready.
The girl was alone the whole day, so the good dwarfs warned
her and said:</p>

<p>"Beware of the Queen; she will soon know that you are here;
be sure to let no one come in."</p>

<p>But the Queen, thinking she had eaten Snow-white's heart,
began to suppose she was again the first and most beautiful person
in the world; and she went to her Looking-glass and said:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">"Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,</p>
<p class="i10">Who in this land is the fairest of all?"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>And the Glass answered:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"O Queen, thou art fairest of all I see,</p>
<p>But over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,</p>
<p>Snow-white is still alive and well,</p>
<p>And no one else is so fair as she."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>And so she thought and thought again how she might kill
Snow-white, for so long as she was not the fairest in the whole
land, envy let her have no rest. And when she had at last
thought of something to do, she painted her face and dressed
herself like an old peddler-woman, and no one could have
known her. Then she went over the seven hills to the seven
dwarfs, and knocked at the door and cried:</p>

<p>"Pretty things to sell, very cheap, very cheap." Little
Snow-white looked out of the window and called out:</p>

<p>"Good-day, my good woman, what have you to sell?"</p>

<p>"Good things, pretty things," she answered; "stay-laces of
all colors," and she pulled out one which was woven of bright
silk.</p>

<p>"I may let the good old woman in," thought Snow-white,
and she unbolted the door and bought the pretty laces.</p>

<p>"Child," said the old woman, "what a fright you look!
Come, I will lace you properly for once."</p>

<a name="page308a" id="page308a"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/0572.jpg"><img src="images/0572-312.jpg" width="312" height="450" alt="Little Snow-White and the Peddler-Woman." border="0" /></a><br /><br />
<p class="center"><b>Little Snow-White and the Peddler-Woman.</b></p>
</div>

<p>Snow-white stood before her, and let herself be laced with
the new laces. But the old woman laced so quickly and laced
so tightly that Snow-white lost her breath and fell down as if
dead. "Now I am the most beautiful," said the Queen to
herself, and ran away.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[page&nbsp;309]</span>
<p>
Not long after, in the evening, the seven dwarfs came home,
but how shocked they were when they saw their dear little
Snow-white lying on the ground! She did not stir or move,
and seemed to be dead. They lifted her up, and, as they saw
that she was laced too tightly, they cut the laces; then she began
to breathe a little, and after a while came to life again. When
the dwarfs heard what had happened they said:</p>

<p>"The old peddler-woman was no one else than the wicked
Queen; take care and let no one come in when we are not with
you."</p>

<p>But the wicked woman, when she was at home again, went
in front of the Glass and asked:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,</p>
<p>Who in this land is the fairest of all?"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>And it answered as before:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"O Queen, thou art fairest of all I see,</p>
<p>But over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,</p>
<p>Snow-white is still alive and well,</p>
<p>And no one else is so fair as she."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>When she heard that, all her blood rushed to her heart with
fear, for she saw plainly that little Snow-white was again alive.</p>

<p>"But now," she said, "I will think of something that shall
put an end to you," and so she made a comb that was full of
poison. Then she took the shape of another old woman. So
she went over the seven hills to the seven dwarfs, knocked at
the door, and cried, "Good things to sell, cheap, cheap!"
Little Snow-white looked out and said:</p>

<p>"Go away; I cannot let any one come in."</p>

<p>"I suppose you can look," said the old woman, and pulled
the comb out and held it up. It pleased the girl so well that
she let herself be coaxed and opened the door. When they
had made a bargain the old woman said, "Now I will comb
you properly for once." Poor little Snow-white had no fear,
and let the old woman do as she pleased, but hardly had she
put the comb in her hair than the poison worked, and the girl
fell down senseless.</p>

<p>"You piece of beauty," said the wicked woman, "you are
done for now," and she went away.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[page&nbsp;310]</span>
<p>
But as good luck would have it, it was almost evening, and
the seven dwarfs soon came home. When they saw Snow-white
lying as if dead upon the ground, they knew at once the
Queen had been there, and they looked and found the comb.
Scarcely had they taken it out when Snow-white came to herself,
and told them what had happened. Then they warned
her once more to be upon her guard and to open the door to
no one.</p>

<p>The Queen, at home, went in front of the Glass, and said:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,</p>
<p>Who in this land is the fairest of all?"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Then it answered as before:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"O Queen, thou art fairest of all I see,</p>
<p>But over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,</p>
<p>Snow-white is still alive and well,</p>
<p>And no one else is so fair as she."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>When she heard the Glass speak thus she trembled and
shook with rage.</p>

<p>"Snow-white shall die," she cried, "even if it costs me my
life!"</p>

<p>She went into a quiet, secret, lonely room, where no one
ever came, and there she made an apple full of poison. It
was white with a red cheek, so that every one who saw it longed
for it; but whoever ate a piece of it must surely die.</p>

<p>When the apple was ready she painted her face, and dressed
herself up as a country-woman, and so she went over the seven
hills to the seven dwarfs. She knocked at the door. Snow-white
put her head out of the window and said:</p>

<p>"I cannot let any one in; the seven dwarfs have told me not
to."</p>

<p>"It is all the same to me," said the woman. "I shall soon
get rid of my apples. There, I will give you one."</p>

<p>"No," said Snow-white, "I dare not take anything."</p>

<p>"Are you afraid of poison?" said the old woman. "Look,
I will cut the apple in two pieces; you eat the red cheek, and I
will eat the white." The apple was so cunningly made that
only the red cheek was poisoned. Snow-white longed for the
fine apple, and when she saw that the woman ate part of it
<span class="left"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>[page&nbsp;311]</span>
she could stand it no longer, and stretched out her hand and
took the other half. But hardly had she a bit of it in her mouth
when she fell down dead. Then the Queen looked at her with
a dreadful look, and laughed aloud and said:</p>

<p>"White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony-wood! This
time the dwarfs cannot wake you up again."</p>

<p>And when she asked of the Looking-glass at home:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,</p>
<p>Who in this land is fairest of all?"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>it answered at last:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"O Queen, in this land thou art fairest of all."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Then her envious heart had rest, so far as an envious heart
can have rest.</p>

<p>When the dwarfs came home in the evening, they found
Snow-white lying upon the ground; she breathed no longer,
and was dead. They lifted her up, unlaced her, combed her
hair, washed her with water and wine, but it was all of no use;
the poor child was dead, and stayed dead. They laid her upon
a bier, and all seven of them sat round it and wept for her, and
wept three whole days.</p>

<p>Then they were going to bury her, but she still looked as
if she were living, and still had her pretty red cheeks. They
said:</p>

<p>"We could not bury her in the dark ground," and they had
a coffin of glass made, so that she could be seen from all sides,
and they laid her in it, and wrote her name upon it in golden
letters, and that she was a King's daughter. Then they put the
coffin out upon the hill, and one of them always stayed by it
and watched it. And birds came too, and wept for Snow-white;
first an owl, then a raven, and last a dove.</p>

<p>And now Snow-white lay a long, long time in the coffin,
and she did not change, but looked as if she were asleep; for
she was as white as snow, as red as blood, and her hair was as
black as ebony.</p>

<p>It happened that a King's son came into the wood, and
went to the dwarfs' house to spend the night. He saw the
<span class="left"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>[page&nbsp;312]</span>
coffin on the hill, and the beautiful Snow-white within it, and
read what was written upon it in golden letters. Then he said
to the dwarfs:</p>

<p>"Let me have the coffin, I will give you whatever you want
for it." But the dwarfs answered:</p>

<p>"We will not part with it for all the gold in the world."
Then he said:</p>

<p>"Let me have it as a gift, for I cannot live without seeing
Snow-white. I will honor and prize her as the dearest thing
I have." As he spoke in this way the good dwarfs took pity
upon him, and gave him the coffin.</p>

<p>And now the King's son had it carried away by his servants
on their shoulders. And it happened that they stumbled over
a tree-stump, and with the shock the piece of apple which Snow-white
had bitten off came out of her throat. And before long
she opened her eyes, lifted up the lid of the coffin, sat up, and
was once more alive.</p>

<p>"Oh, heavens, where am I?" she cried. The King's son,
full of joy, said:</p>

<p>"You are with me," and told her what had happened,
and said, "I love you more than everything in the world; come
with me to my father's palace; you shall be my wife."</p>

<p>Snow-white was willing, and went with him, and their
wedding was held with great show and splendor. The wicked
Queen was also bidden to the feast. When she had put on her
beautiful clothes, she went before the Looking-glass, and
said:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,</p>
<p>Who in this land is the fairest of all?"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The Glass answered:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"O Queen, of all here the fairest art thou,</p>
<p>But the young Queen is fairer by far I trow."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Then the wicked woman gave a scream, and was so wretched,
so utterly wretched, that she knew not what to do. At first
she would not go to the wedding at all, but she had no peace,
and must go to see the young Queen. And when she went in
she knew Snow-white; and she stood still with rage and fear,
<span class="left"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[page&nbsp;313]</span>
and could not stir. But iron slippers had already been put upon
the fire, and they were brought in with tongs, and set before
her. Then she was forced to put on the red hot shoes, and
dance until she dropped down dead.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/clovers3a.png" width="94" height="15" alt="clover-leaves" border="0" /></div>

<h2>THE GOOSE-GIRL</h2>

<h4>BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">A</span></p>
<p><b>N</b> old Queen had a beautiful daughter, who was betrothed to
a young Prince of a neighboring kingdom. When the time
for the marriage came near, it was arranged that she was to
travel to his country accompanied only by her waiting-maid.
Her mother, the Queen, provided her with many costly robes
and jewels, such as a Princess about to marry the Prince of a
great kingdom would require. She also gave her a horse named
Falada, which had the gift of speech.</p>

<p>Just before the Princess started on her journey, the Queen
pricked her finger, and dropped three drops of blood upon a
handkerchief. "Take this," she told her daughter, "and
guard it carefully. It will serve you when in danger."</p>

<p>The Princess took the handkerchief, and embraced her
mother. They shed many tears at parting, but at last the Princess
mounted the wonderful horse and started on the journey.
When she and the maid had ridden for some time, they came to
a stream of clear, cold water. Being very thirsty, the Princess
asked the maid to bring her a drink in the golden cup. The
maid insolently replied that she might get the water for herself,
as she did not intend to serve her any longer. The Princess
was so thirsty that she dismounted and drank from the stream.
As she bent over to place her lips to the water, she said to herself,
"O, Heaven! what am I to do?" The three drops of blood
upon the handkerchief made answer:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"If she knew this, for thy sake</p>
<p>Thy queen-mother's heart would break."</p>
  </div>  </div>
<span class="left"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[page&nbsp;314]</span>

<p>When the Princess had slaked her thirst, she mounted her
horse and resumed her journey, and being gentle and forgiving,
she soon forgot the maid's rudeness. The sun shone on them
fiercely, and the road was filled with dust, so that they had
not gone far before the Princess again became thirsty. When
they came to a brook, she called to the maid:</p>

<p>"Pray fetch me a drink in my golden cup."</p>

<p>The maid's answer was even more insolent than before.
"If you are thirsty, get down and drink. I do not mean to
serve you any longer."</p>

<p>The Princess's throat was parched, so she dismounted and
drank from the stream, at the same time murmuring, "O,
Heaven! what am I to do?" The three drops of blood again
replied:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"If she knew this, for thy sake</p>
<p>Thy queen-mother's heart would break."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>As she raised her head from the water, the handkerchief
bearing the three drops of blood fell unnoticed from her dress
and floated down the stream. The maid, however, had observed
the loss with no small satisfaction. Without the three drops
of blood, the Princess was completely in her power, and the
traitorous servant immediately took advantage of her helplessness.
She obliged the Princess to disrobe and exchange the
royal dress for her own mean one. After making her swear,
on fear of death, never to betray the secret, the maid mounted
Falada and left her own horse for the Princess.</p>

<p>Falada bore the false Princess to the palace; but the horse
had noted all, and bided his time. The Prince came out to meet
them, and took the impostor bride to the royal chamber, while
the true one was left waiting in the court below. Seeing her
there, forlorn and beautiful, the old King inquired of the bride
who it was she had thus left outside.</p>

<p>"Only a woman who kept me company," she carelessly replied.
"Give her some work to content her."</p>

<p>The King could think of nothing suitable for such as she; but
lacking something better to offer, sent her to help the boy
Curdken herd geese. So it happened that the real bride became a
goose-girl.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>[page&nbsp;315]</span>

<p>The false bride at length remembered Falada's gift of speech
and became alarmed lest he should betray the secret of her
treachery. She told the Prince that the horse which had brought
her was vicious and had given her much trouble, and that she
desired his head cut off immediately. The Prince at once
granted her request, and gave orders that Falada be beheaded.</p>

<p>When the real Princess heard the sad news, she dried her
tears and sought the executioner. She could not save her dear
Falada from his doom, but with the aid of a gold piece she persuaded
the slaughterer to nail his head over the great gate
through which she had to pass on her way to and from the goose-pasture.</p>

<p>The next morning, when she and Curdken drove their geese
under the gate, the Princess wrung her hands and cried:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"O Falada, hang you there?"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>And the head replied to her:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"'Tis Falada, Princess fair.</p>
<p>If she knew this, for thy sake</p>
<p>Thy queen-mother's heart would break."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>When she had driven the geese to the field, she sat down and
loosed her golden hair. Curdken, seeing it shining in the sun,
caught at it to pull some out. Whereupon she sang:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Wind, blow gently here, I pray,</p>
<p>And take Curdken's hat away.</p>
<p>Keep him chasing o'er the wold,</p>
<p>While I bind my hair of gold."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>When Curdken had recovered his hat and returned to where
she was sitting, her hair was plaited, and he could get none of it.
This made him very angry all day.</p>

<p>The next morning they again came to the gate where Falada's
head was nailed, and the goose-girl said as before:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"O Falada, hang you there?"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>And the head as before replied to her:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"'Tis Falada, Princess fair.</p>
<p>If she knew this, for thy sake</p>
<p>Thy queen-mother's heart would break."</p>
  </div>  </div>
<span class="left"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[page&nbsp;316]</span>

<p>Again she passed on with the geese and Curdken under the
gate, and when she came to the field where they were herded, sat
down and loosed her hair. The sun shone upon it, and Curdken
again caught at its golden threads. The goose-girl called to the
wind:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Wind, blow gently here, I pray,</p>
<p>And take Curdken's hat away.</p>
<p>Keep him chasing o'er the wold,</p>
<p>While I bind my hair of gold."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The wind did as she asked, and Curdken ran so far for his
hat that when he returned the golden hair was plaited and bound
about her head.</p>

<p>Curdken was sullen all day long, and when at night they had
driven the geese home, he complained to the King:</p>

<p>"The goose-girl so teases me that I will no longer herd the
geese with her."</p>

<p>When asked how she had offended, he told the King that she
spoke every morning to the horse's head that was over the gate,
and that the head replied and called her Princess. He also related
how the goose-girl sat in the sun and combed her golden
hair, while she sent him chasing for his hat.</p>

<p>The King bade Curdken go the next day with his flock as
usual. When morning came the King arose early and stood in
the shadow of the town-gate. He heard the goose-girl say,
"O Falada, hang you there?" and he heard the head make
answer:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"'Tis Falada, Princess fair.</p>
<p>If she knew this, for thy sake</p>
<p>Thy queen-mother's heart would break."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Then the King followed on to the field, where he hid behind a
bush and watched them herd the geese. After a time the goose-girl
undid her glittering hair; and as Curdken snatched at it, the
King heard her say:</p>

The wind came at her bidding, and carried the herd-boy's hat
across the fields; while she combed the shining hair and made it
fast.</p>

<p>The King quietly returned to the palace, and that night he
sent for the goose-girl. He told her he had watched her at the
gate and in the field, and asked her the meaning of her strange
actions.</p>

<p>"O King! I may not tell; for I have sworn, if my life were
spared, to speak to no one of my woes," she replied.</p>

<p>The King pleaded with her, but she was firm; and at
last he told her to tell her troubles to the iron stove, since
she would not confide in him. When he had left her, she
fell upon her knees before the stove and poured forth her sorrows:</p>

<p>"Here am I, the daughter of a Queen, doomed to the lowly
service of a goose-girl, while the false waiting-maid steals my
treasures and my bridegroom."</p>

<p>She sobbed and wept, until the King, who had stood outside
and heard all, came in and bade her dry her eyes. He ordered
her arrayed in royal robes; and then she appeared as lovely as the
sun. The Prince was summoned; and the old King told him the
story, and showed him the true bride. She was so beautiful that
the Prince knelt at her feet in admiration, and knew her to be the
real Princess.</p>

<p>A great banquet was given, to which many guests were invited.
On one side of the Prince sat the false bride, and on the
other the real Princess, who was so radiantly lovely that the maid
did not know her. The King at last asked the waiting-maid
what punishment should be dealt to a traitor.</p>

<p>Not knowing that she was passing sentence on herself, the
waiting-maid's answer was as cruel as she was wicked. Said
she:</p>

<p>"Let her be put into a barrel, and drawn by two white horses,
up hill and down, till she is dead."</p>

<p>When the wicked maid had been punished according to her
own decree, the Princess was wedded to the young Prince, and
reigned with him for many happy years over the kingdom where
she had first served as a goose-girl.</p>

<h2>THE GOLDEN BIRD</h2>

<h4>BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HERE</b> was once a King who had a beautiful pleasure-garden
behind his palace, in which grew a tree that bore golden
apples. As fast as the apples ripened they were counted, but
the next day one was always missing.</p>

<p>This was made known to the King, who commanded that
a watch should be kept every night under the tree. Now, the
King had three sons, and he sent the eldest into the garden when
night was coming on; but at midnight he fell fast asleep, and in
the morning another apple was missing. The following night
the second son had to watch, but he did not succeed any better,
and again another apple was missing in the morning. Now
came the turn of the youngest son, who was eager to go; but
the King did not rely much upon him, and thought he would
watch even worse than his brothers; however, at last he consented.</p>

<p>The youth threw himself on the ground under the tree and
watched steadily, without letting sleep master him. As twelve
o'clock struck, something rustled in the air, and he saw a bird
fly by in the moonlight, whose feathers were of shining gold.
The bird alighted on the tree and was just picking off one of
the apples when the young Prince shot a bolt at it. Away
flew the bird, but the arrow had knocked off one of its feathers,
which was of the finest gold. The youth picked it up and
showed it to the King next morning, and told him all he had
seen in the night.</p>

<p>Thereupon the King assembled his council, and each one
declared that a single feather like this one was of greater value
than the whole kingdom.</p>

<p>"However valuable this feather may be," said the King, "one
will not be of much use to me&mdash;I must have the whole bird."</p>

<p>So the eldest son went forth on his travels, to look for the
wonderful bird, and he had no doubt that he would be able to
find it.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>[page&nbsp;319]</span>

<p>When he had gone a short distance, he saw a fox sitting close
to the edge of the forest, so he drew his bow to shoot. But
the fox cried out: "Do not shoot me, and I will give you a
piece of good advice! You are now on the road to the golden
bird, and this evening you will come to a village where two
inns stand opposite to each other&mdash;one will be brilliantly lighted,
and great merriment will be going on inside; do not, however,
go in, but rather enter the other, even though it appears but a
poor place to you."</p>

<p>"How can such a ridiculous animal give me rational advice?"
thought the young Prince, and shot at the fox, but missed it, so
it ran away with its tail in the air. The King's son then walked
on, and in the evening he came to a village where the two inns
stood: in one there was dancing and singing, but the other was
quiet, and had a very mean and wretched appearance.</p>

<p>"I should be an idiot," thought he to himself, "if I were to
go to this gloomy old inn while the other is so bright and cheerful."
Therefore, he went into the merry one, lived there in
rioting and revelry, and so forgot the golden bird, his father,
and all good behavior.</p>

<p>As time passed away, and the eldest son did not return
home, the second son set out on his travels to seek the golden
bird. Like the eldest brother, he met with the fox, and did not
follow the good advice it gave him. He likewise came to the
two inns, and at the window of the noisy one his brother stood
entreating him to come in. This he could not resist, so he went
in, and began to live a life of pleasure only.</p>

<p>Again a long time passed by without any news, so the youngest
Prince wished to try his luck, but his father would not hear
of it. At last, for the sake of peace, the King was obliged to
consent, for he had no rest as long as he refused. The fox
was again sitting at the edge of the forest, and once more it
begged for its own life and gave its good advice. The youth
was good-hearted, and said:</p>

<p>"Have no fear, little fox; I will not do thee any harm."</p>

<p>"Thou wilt never repent of thy good nature," replied the
fox, "and in order that thou mayest travel more quickly, get
up behind on my tail."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>[page&nbsp;320]</span>

<p>Scarcely had the youth seated himself, when away went the
fox over hill and dale, so fast that the Prince's hair whistled
in the wind. When they came to the village, the youth dismounted,
and following the fox's advice, he turned at once into
the shabby-looking inn, where he slept peacefully through the
night. The next morning, when the Prince went into the
fields, the fox was already there, and said:</p>

<p>"I will tell thee what further thou must do. Go straight
on, and thou wilt come to a castle before which a whole troop
of soldiers will be lying asleep. Go right through the midst
of them into the castle, and thou wilt come to a chamber where
is hanging a wooden cage containing a golden bird. Close
by stands an empty golden cage, for show; but be careful that
thou dost not take the bird out of its ugly cage and put it in the
splendid one, or it will be very unlucky for thee."</p>

<p>With these words the fox once more stretched out its tail,
and the King's son sat upon it again, and away they went over
hill and dale, with their hair whistling in the wind.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the castle, the Prince found everything
as the fox had said, and he soon discovered the room in
which the golden bird was sitting in its wooden cage; by it
stood a golden one; while three golden apples were lying about
the room. But the Prince thought it would be silly to put such
a lovely bird in so ugly and common a cage; so, opening the
door, he placed it in the golden cage. In an instant the bird
set up a piercing shriek, which awakened all the soldiers, who
rushed in and made him prisoner.</p>

<p>The next morning he was brought before a judge, who at
once condemned him to death. Still, the King said his life
should be spared on one condition, and that was, that he brought
him the golden horse, which ran faster than the wind; and if
he succeeded he should also receive the golden bird as a reward.</p>

<p>The young Prince set out on his journey, but he sighed and
felt very sorrowful, for where was he to find the golden horse?
All at once, he saw his old friend, the fox, sitting by the wayside.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the fox, "thou seest now what has happened
through not listening to me. But be of good courage; I
will look after thee, and tell thee how thou mayest discover the
<span class="left"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>[page&nbsp;321]</span>
horse. Thou must travel straight along this road until thou
comest to a castle; the horse is there in one of the stables. Thou
wilt find a stable boy lying before the stall, but he will be fast
asleep and snoring, so thou wilt be able to lead out the golden
horse quite quietly. But there is one thing thou must be
careful about, and that is to put on the shabby old saddle of
wood and leather, and not the golden one which hangs beside
it&mdash;otherwise everything will go wrong with thee." Then the
fox stretched out his tail, the Prince took a seat upon it, and
away they went over hill and dale, with their hair whistling in
the wind.</p>

<p>Everything happened as the fox had said. The Prince
came to the stable where the golden horse was standing, but,
as he was about to put on the shabby old saddle, he thought
to himself, "It does seem a shame that such a lovely animal
should be disgraced with this. The fine saddle is his by right;
it must go on."</p>

<p>Scarcely had the golden saddle rested on the horse's back
when it began to neigh loudly. This awakened the stable
boy, who awakened the grooms, who rushed in and seized the
Prince and made him a prisoner. The following morning he
was brought to trial and condemned to death, but the King
promised him his life, as well as the golden horse, if the youth
could find the beautiful daughter of the King of the golden
castle. Once more, with a heavy heart, the Prince set out on
his journey, and by great good fortune he soon came across
the faithful fox.</p>

<p>"I really should have left thee to the consequences of thy
folly," said the fox; "but as I feel great compassion for thee, I
will help thee out of thy new misfortune. The path to the
castle lies straight before thee; thou wilt reach it about the
evening. At night, when everything is quiet, the lovely Princess
will go to the bath-house, to bathe there. As soon as she
enters, thou must spring forward and give her a kiss; then she
will follow thee wherever thou carest to lead her; only be careful
that she does not take leave of her parents, or everything
will go wrong."</p>

<p>Then the fox stretched out his tail, the Prince seated himself
<span class="left"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>[page&nbsp;322]</span>
on it, and away they both went over hill and dale, their
hair whistling in the wind.</p>

<p>When the King's son came to the golden palace, everything
happened as the fox had predicted. He waited until midnight,
and when everyone was soundly asleep the beautiful Princess
went into the bath-house, so he sprang forward and kissed her.
The Princess then said she would joyfully follow him, but she
besought him with tears in her eyes to allow her to say farewell
to her parents. At first he withstood her entreaties, but as
she wept still more, and fell at his feet, he at last yielded.</p>

<p>Scarcely was the maiden at the bedside of her father, when
he awoke, and so did everyone else in the palace; so the foolish
youth was captured and put into prison.</p>

<p>On the following morning the King said to him: "Thy
life is forfeited, and thou canst only find mercy if thou clearest
away the mountain that lies before my windows, and over
which I cannot see, but it must be removed within eight
days. If thou dost succeed thou shalt have my daughter as a
reward."</p>

<p>So the Prince commenced at once to dig and to shovel away
the earth without cessation, but when after seven days he saw
how little he had been able to accomplish, and that all his
labor was as nothing, he fell into a great grief and gave up all
hope.</p>

<p>On the evening of the seventh day, however, the fox appeared.
"Thou dost not deserve that I should take thy part or
befriend thee, but do thou go away and lie down to sleep, and I
will do the work for thee."</p>

<p>And the next morning, when he awoke and looked out of
the window, the mountain had disappeared! Then the Prince,
quite overjoyed, hastened to the King and told him that the
conditions were fulfilled, so that the King, whether he would
or not, was obliged to keep his word and give him his daughter.</p>

<p>Then these two went away together, and it was not long
before the faithful fox came to them.</p>

<p>"Thou hast indeed gained the best of all," said he; "but to
the maiden of the golden castle belongs also the golden horse."</p>

<p>"How can I get it?" enquired the youth.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>[page&nbsp;323]</span>

<p>"I will tell thee," answered the fox; "first of all, take the
lovely Princess to the King who sent you to the golden palace.
There will then be unheard-of joy; they will gladly lead the
golden horse to thee and give it thee. Mount it instantly, and
give your hand to everyone at parting, and last of all to the Princess.
Grasp her hand firmly; make her spring into the
saddle behind thee, and then gallop away; no one will be able
to overtake thee, for the golden horse runs faster than the
wind."</p>

<p>This was all happily accomplished, and the King's
son carried off the beautiful Princess on the golden horse. The
fox did not remain behind, and spoke thus to the young
Prince:</p>

<p>"Now I will help thee to find the golden bird. When thou
comest near the castle where the bird is to be found, let the Princess
dismount, and I will take her under my protection. Then
ride on the golden horse to the courtyard of the palace, where thy
coming will cause great joy, and they will fetch the golden bird
for thee. Directly the cage is in thy hands, gallop back to us
and fetch the maiden again."</p>

<a name="page323a" id="page323a"></a>
<div class="figcenter">

<p class="center"><b>The Prince Starts Homeward with His Treasure.</b></p>
</div>

<p>When this plot was successfully carried out, and the Prince
was about to ride home with his treasure, the fox said, "Now
must thou reward me for all my services."</p>

<p>"What is it that thou dost desire?" enquired the Prince.</p>

<p>"When we come to yonder wood, thou must shoot me dead
and cut off my head and paws."</p>

<p>"That would be a fine sort of gratitude," said the King's son;
"that I cannot possibly promise thee."</p>

<p>"Then," replied the fox, "if thou wilt not, I must leave thee;
but before I go I will give thee again some good advice. Beware
of two things&mdash;buy no gallows'-flesh, and see that thou dost not
sit on the brink of a well!"</p>

<p>With this the fox ran off into the forest!</p>

<p>"Ah!" thought the young Prince, "that is a wonderful
animal with very whimsical ideas! Who would buy gallows'-flesh,
and when have I ever had the slightest desire to sit on the
brink of a well?"</p>

<p>So he rode on with the beautiful maiden, and his path led
<span class="left"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>[page&nbsp;324]</span>
him once more through the village in which his two brothers had
stopped. Here there was great tumult and lamentation, and
when he asked what it all meant, he was told that two men were
going to be hanged. When he came nearer, he saw that they
were his two brothers, who had committed every kind of wicked
folly and had squandered all their money. Then the young
Prince asked if they could not be freed.</p>

<p>"Supposing you do pay for them," the people answered,
"where is the good of wasting your money in order to free such
villains?"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he did not hesitate, but paid for them, and
when the brothers were freed they all rode away together. They
came to the forest where they first encountered the fox, and as it
was cool and pleasant away from the burning sun, the two
brothers said:</p>

<p>"Let us sit and rest a little by this well, and eat and drink
something."</p>

<p>The young Prince consented, and while they were all talking
together he quite forgot the fox's warning, and suspected no evil.</p>

<p>But suddenly the two brothers threw him backwards into the
well, and, seizing the maiden, the horse, and the golden bird, they
went home to their father.</p>

<p>"We not only bring you the golden bird," said they, "but
we have also found the golden palace."</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing, but the horse would not eat,
neither would the bird sing, and the maiden only sat and
wept.</p>

<p>But the youngest brother had not perished. By good fortune
the well was dry, and he had fallen on soft moss without hurting
himself, but he could not get out again.</p>

<p>Even in this misfortune the faithful fox did not desert him,
but came springing down to him and scolded him for not following
his advice.</p>

<p>"Still I cannot forsake thee," said he, "and I will help to
show thee daylight once more."</p>

<p>Then he told him to seize hold of his tail and hold on tightly;
and so saying, he lifted him up in the air.</p>

<p>"Even now thou art not out of danger," said the fox, "for
<span class="left"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>[page&nbsp;325]</span>
thy brothers were not certain of thy death, and have set spies to
watch for thee in the forest, who will certainly kill thee if they see
thee."</p>

<p>There was an old man sitting by the wayside with whom the
young Prince changed clothes, and, thus disguised, he reached
the court of the King.</p>

<p>No one recognized him, but the golden bird began to sing,
and the golden horse commenced to eat, and the lovely maiden
ceased to weep.</p>

<p>The King was astonished and asked: "What does this all
mean?"</p>

<p>Then said the maiden: "I know not, but I was so sad, and
now I feel light-hearted; it is as if my true husband had returned."</p>

<p>Then she told him all that had happened, although the
other brothers had threatened to kill her if she betrayed
them.</p>

<p>The King then summoned all the people in the castle before
him: and there came with them the young Prince dressed
as a beggar in his rags, but the maiden recognized him instantly
and fell upon his neck.</p>

<p>So the wicked brothers were seized and executed, but the
young Prince married the lovely Princess and was made his
father's heir.</p>

<p>But what became of the poor fox?</p>

<p>Long afterwards the young Prince went again into the
forest, and there he met once more with the fox, who said:</p>

<p>"Thou hast now everything in the world thou canst desire,
but to my misfortunes there can be no end, although it is in
thy power to release me from them."</p>

<p>So he entreated the Prince to shoot him dead and cut off
his head and feet.</p>

<p>At last the Prince consented to do so, and scarcely was the
deed done than the fox was changed into a man, who was no
other than the brother of the beautiful Princess, at last released
from the spell that had bound him.</p>

<p>So now nothing was wanting to the happiness of the Prince
and his bride as long as they lived.</p>

<h2>BEAUTY AND THE BEAST</h2>

<h4>ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> upon a time there was a rich merchant, who had
three daughters. They lived in a very fine house in a
beautiful city, and had many servants in grand liveries to wait
upon them. All their food was served on gold and silver dishes,
and their gowns were made of the richest stuff sewn with jewels.</p>

<p>The two eldest were called Marigold and Dressalinda.
Never a day passed but these two went out to some feast or
junketing; but Beauty, the youngest, loved to stay at home and
keep her old father company.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that misfortune came upon the merchant.
Ships of his which were sailing the high seas laden with merchandise
of great price, were wrecked, and in one day he found
that he was no longer the richest merchant in the city, but a
very poor man.</p>

<p>There was still left to him a little house in the country,
and to this, when everything else had been sold, he retired.
His three daughters, of course, went with him.</p>

<p>Marigold and Dressalinda were very cross to think that
they had lost all their money, and after being so rich and
sought after, they must now live in a miserable cottage.</p>

<p>But Beauty's only thought was to cheer her old father,
and while her two sisters sat on wooden chairs and cried and
bewailed themselves, Beauty lighted the fire and got the supper
ready, for the merchant was now so poor that he could not even
keep a servant.</p>

<p>And so it went on. The two eldest sisters would do nothing
but sulk in corners, while Beauty swept the floors and washed
the dishes, and did her best to make the poor cottage pleasant.
<span class="left"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>[page&nbsp;327]</span>
They led their sister a dreadful life too, with their complaints,
for not only did they refuse to do anything themselves, but
they said that everything she did was done wrong. But Beauty
bore all their unkindness patiently, for her father's sake.</p>

<p>In this way a whole year went by, and then one day a letter
came for the merchant.</p>

<p>He hastened to find his daughters, for he was anxious to
tell them the good news contained in the letter.</p>

<p>"My dear children," he said, "at last our luck has turned.
This letter says that one of the ships supposed to have been
lost has come safely home to port, and if that be so, we need
no longer live in poverty. We shall not be so rich as before,
but we shall have enough to keep us in comfort. Get me my
traveling-cloak, Beauty. I will set out at once to claim my
ship. And now tell me, girls, what shall I bring you when
I come back?"</p>

<p>"A hundred pounds," said Marigold, without hesitating
an instant.</p>

<p>"I want a new silk dress," said Dressalinda, "an apple-green
one, sewn with seed-pearls, and green shoes with red
heels, and a necklace of emeralds, and a box of gloves."</p>

<p>"And what shall I bring for you, my Beauty?" asked the
father, as his little daughter helped him to put on his
traveling-cloak.</p>

<p>"Oh, bring me a rose," said Beauty hastily.</p>

<p>Her father kissed her fondly, and set out.</p>

<p>"You silly girl," said Marigold, "you just want our father
to think you are more unselfish than we are&mdash;that's what you
want! A rose, indeed!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, sister," said Beauty, "that was not the reason.
I thought our father would have enough to do in seeing to the
safety of his ship, without being troubled to do shopping for me."</p>

<p>But the sisters were very much offended, and went off to
sit in their own room to talk of the fine things they would have
when their father came back.</p>

<p>In the meantime the merchant went his way to the city,
full of hope and great plans as to what he would do with his
money.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>[page&nbsp;328]</span>

<p>But when he got there, he found that some one had played
a trick on him, and no ship of his had come into harbor, so
he was just as badly off as before.</p>

<p>He spent the whole day looking about to make sure there
was no truth in the letter he had received, and it was beginning
to get dusk when he started out, with a sad heart, to make the
journey home again. He was tired and miserable, and he had
tasted no food since he left home in the morning.</p>

<p>It was quite dark by the time he came to the great wood
through which he had to pass to get to his cottage, and when
he saw a light shining through the trees, he decided not to go
to his home that night, but to make his way towards the light
in the wood and ask for food and shelter.</p>

<p>He expected to find a woodcutter's cottage, but what was
his surprise, as he drew near to the light, to find that it came
from the windows of a large and beautiful palace!</p>

<p>He knocked at the gates, but no one answered, and presently,
driven by hunger and cold, he made bold to enter, and
mounted the marble steps into the great hall.</p>

<p>All the way he never saw a soul. There was a big fire in
the hall, and when he had warmed himself, he set out to look
for the master of the house. But he did not look far, for behind
the first door he opened was a cosy little room with supper
set for one, a supper the mere look of which made you hungry.</p>

<p>So the merchant sat down as bold as you please, and made
a very hearty supper, after which he again thought he would
look for the master of the house.</p>

<p>He started off and opened another door, but there he saw a
bed, merely to look at which made you sleepy, so he said to
himself:</p>

<p>"This is some fairies' work. I had better not look any
farther for the master of the house."</p>

<p>And with that he tumbled into bed, and, being very tired,
he went to sleep at once, and slept like a top till it was time to
get up in the morning.</p>

<p>When he awoke he was quite surprised to find himself in
such a soft and comfortable bed, but presently he remembered
all that had happened to him.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>[page&nbsp;329]</span>

<p>"I must be going," he said to himself, "but I wish I could
thank my host for my good rest and my good supper."</p>

<p>When he got out of bed he found he had something else to
be grateful for, for on the chair by the bedside lay a fine suit of
new clothes, marked with his name, and with ten gold pieces
in every pocket. He felt quite a different man when he had
put on the suit of blue and silver, and jingled the gold pieces
of money in his pockets.</p>

<p>When he went downstairs, he found a good breakfast waiting
for him in the little room where he had supped the night
before, and when he had made a good meal, he thought he
would go for a stroll in the garden.</p>

<p>Down the marble steps he went, and when he came to the
garden, he saw that it was full of roses, red and white and pink
and yellow, and the merchant looked at them, and remembered
Beauty's wish.</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor daughters," he said, "what a disappointment
it will be to them to know that my ship has not come
home after all, but Beauty at any rate can have what she
wanted."</p>

<p>So he stretched out his hand and plucked the biggest red
rose within his reach.</p>

<p>As the stalk snapped in his fingers, he started back in terror,
for he heard an angry roar, and the next minute a dreadful
Beast sprang upon him. It was taller than any man, and
uglier than any animal, but, what seemed most dreadful of all
to the merchant, it spoke to him with a man's voice, after it
had roared at him with the Beast's.</p>

<p>"Ungrateful wretch!" said the Beast. "Have I not fed
you, lodged you, and clothed you, and now you must repay my
hospitality by stealing the only thing I care for, my roses?"</p>

<p>"Mercy! mercy!" cried the merchant.</p>

<p>"No," said the Beast, "you must die!" The poor merchant
fell upon his knees and tried to think of something to say to
soften the heart of the cruel Beast; and at last he said, "Sir,
I only stole this rose because my youngest daughter asked me to
bring her one. I did not think, after all you have given me,
that you would grudge me a flower."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>[page&nbsp;330]</span>

<p>"Tell me about this daughter of yours," said the Beast
suddenly. "Is she a good girl?"</p>

<p>"The best and dearest in the world," said the old merchant.
And then he began to weep, to think that he must die and leave
his Beauty alone in the world, with no one to be kind to her.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he cried, "what will my poor children do without
me?"</p>

<p>"You should have thought of that before you stole the
rose," said the Beast. "However, if one of your daughters
loves you well enough to suffer instead of you, she may. Go
back and tell them what has happened to you, but you must
give me your promise that either you, or one of your daughters,
shall be at my palace door in three months' time from to-day."</p>

<p>The wretched man promised.</p>

<p>"At any rate," he thought, "I shall have three months more
of life."</p>

<p>Then the Beast said, "I will not let you go empty-handed."</p>

<p>So the merchant followed him back into the palace. There,
on the floor of the hall, lay a great and beautiful chest of wrought
silver.</p>

<p>"Fill this with any treasures that take your fancy," said
the Beast.</p>

<p>And the merchant filled it up with precious things from the
Beast's treasure-house.</p>

<p>"I will send it home for you," said the Beast, shutting down
the lid.</p>

<p>And so, with a heavy heart, the merchant went away; but
as he went through the palace gate, the Beast called to him
that he had forgotten Beauty's rose, and at the same time held
out to him a large bunch of the very best.</p>

<p>The merchant put these into Beauty's hand when she ran to
meet him at the door of their cottage.</p>

<p>"Take them, my child," he said, "and cherish them, for
they have cost your poor father his life."</p>

<p>And with that he sat down and told them the whole story.
The two elder sisters wept and wailed, and of course blamed
Beauty for all that had happened.</p>

<p>"If it had not been for your wanting a rose, our father would
<span class="left"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>[page&nbsp;331]</span>
have left the palace in safety, with his new suit and his gold
pieces; but your foolishness has cost him his life."</p>

<p>"No," said Beauty, "it is <i>my</i> life that shall be sacrificed,
for when the three months are over, I shall go to the Beast,
and he may kill me if he will, but he shall never hurt my dear
father."</p>

<p>The father tried hard to persuade her not to go, but she had
made up her mind, and at the end of the three months she set
out for the Beast's palace.</p>

<p>Her father went with her, to show her the way. As before,
he saw the lights shining through the wood, knocked and rang
in vain at the great gate, warmed himself at the fire in the big
hall, and then found the little room with the supper on the table
that made you hungry to look at. Only this time the table
was laid for two.</p>

<p>"Come, father dear," said Beauty, "take comfort. I do
not think the Beast means to kill me, or surely he would not
have given me such a good supper."</p>

<p>But the next moment the Beast came into the room. Beauty
screamed and clung to her father.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened," said the Beast gently, "but tell me,
do you come here of your own free will?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Beauty, trembling.</p>

<p>"You are a good girl," said the Beast, and then, turning to
the old man, he told him that he might sleep there for that
night, but in the morning he must go and leave his daughter
behind him.</p>

<p>They went to bed and slept soundly, and the next morning
the father departed, weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>Beauty, left alone, tried not to feel frightened. She ran here
and there through the palace, and found it more beautiful than
anything she had ever imagined.</p>

<p>The most beautiful set of rooms in the palace had written
over the doors, "Beauty's Rooms," and in them she found
books and music, canary-birds and Persian cats, and everything
that could be thought of to make the time pass pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" she said; "if only I could see my poor father
I should be almost happy."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>[page&nbsp;332]</span>

<p>As she spoke, she happened to look at a big mirror, and in
it she saw the form of her father reflected, just riding up to the
door of his cottage.</p>

<p>That night, when Beauty sat down to supper, the Beast
came in.</p>

<p>"May I have supper with you?" said he.</p>

<p>"That must be as you please," said Beauty.</p>

<p>So the Beast sat down to supper with her, and when it was
finished, he said:</p>

<p>"I am very ugly, Beauty, and I am very stupid, but I love
you; will you marry me?"</p>

<p>"No, Beast," said Beauty gently.</p>

<p>The poor Beast sighed and went away.</p>

<p>And every night the same thing happened. He ate his
supper with her, and then asked her if she would marry him.
And she always said, "No, Beast."</p>

<p>All this time she was waited on by invisible hands, as though
she had been a queen. Beautiful music came to her ears
without her being able to see the musicians, but the magic
looking-glass was best of all, for in it she could see whatever
she wished. As the days went by, and her slightest wish was
granted, almost before she knew what she wanted, she began to
feel that the Beast must love her very dearly, and she was very
sorry to see how sad he looked every night when she said
"No" to his offer of marriage.</p>

<p>One day, she saw in her mirror that her father was ill, so
that night she said to the Beast:</p>

<p>"Dear Beast, you are so good to me, will you let me go
home to see my father? He is ill, and he thinks that I am dead.
Do let me go and cheer him up, and I will promise faithfully
to return to you."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Beast kindly, "but don't stay away
more than a week, for if you do, I shall die of grief, because I
love you so dearly."</p>

<p>"How shall I reach home?" said Beauty; "I do not know
the way."</p>

<p>Then the Beast gave her a ring, and told her to put it on her
finger when she went to bed, turn the ruby towards the palm
<span class="left"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>[page&nbsp;333]</span>
of her hand, and then she would wake up in her father's cottage.
When she wanted to come back, she was to do the same thing.</p>

<p>So in the morning, when she awoke, she found herself at
her father's house, and the old man was beside himself with
joy to see her safe and sound.</p>

<p>But her sisters did not welcome her very kindly, and when
they heard how kind the Beast was to her, they envied her her
good luck in living in a beautiful palace, whilst they had to be
content with a cottage.</p>

<p>"I wish we had gone," said Marigold. "Beauty always
gets the best of everything."</p>

<p>"Tell us all about your grand palace," said Dressalinda,
"and what you do, and how you spend your time."</p>

<p>So Beauty, thinking it would amuse them to hear, told them,
and their envy increased day by day. At last Dressalinda
said to Marigold:</p>

<p>"She has promised to return in a week. If we could only
make her forget the day, the Beast might be angry and kill
her, and then there would be a chance for us."</p>

<p>So on the day before she ought to have gone back, they put,
some poppy juice in a cup of wine which they gave her, and
this made her so sleepy that she slept for two whole days and
nights. At the end of that time her sleep grew troubled, and
she dreamed that She saw the Beast lying dead among the
roses in the beautiful gardens of his palace; and from this dream
she awoke crying bitterly.</p>

<p>Although she did not know that a week and two days had
gone by since she left the Beast, yet after that dream she at
once turned the ruby towards her palm, and the next morning
there she was, sure enough, in her bed in the Beast's palace.</p>

<p>She did not know where his rooms in the palace were, but
she felt she could not wait till supper-time before seeing him,
so she ran hither and thither, calling his name. But the palace
was empty, and no one answered her when she called.</p>

<p>Then she ran through the gardens, calling his name again
and again, but still there was silence.</p>

<p>"Oh! what shall I do if I cannot find him?" she said. "I
shall never be happy again."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>[page&nbsp;334]</span>

<p>Then she remembered her dream, and ran to the rose
garden, and there, sure enough, beside the basin of the big
fountain, lay the poor Beast without any sign of life in him.</p>

<p>Beauty flung herself on her knees beside him.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear Beast," she cried, "and are you really dead?
Alas! alas! then I, too, will die, for I cannot live without you."</p>

<p>Immediately the Beast opened his eyes, sighed, and said:</p>

<p>"Beauty, will you marry me?"</p>

<p>And Beauty, beside herself with joy when she found that
he was still alive, answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, dear Beast, for I love you dearly."</p>

<p>At these words the rough fur dropped to the ground, and in
place of the Beast stood a handsome Prince, dressed in a doublet
of white and silver, like one made ready for a wedding. He
knelt at Beauty's feet and clasped her hands.</p>

<p>"Dear Beauty," he said, "nothing but your love could have
disenchanted me. A wicked fairy turned me into a Beast, and
condemned me to remain one until some fair and good maiden
should love me well enough to marry me, in spite of my ugliness
and stupidity. Now, dear one, the enchantment is broken;
let us go back to my palace. You will find that all my servants&mdash;who,
too, have been enchanted, and have waited on
you all this long time with invisible hands&mdash;will now become
visible."</p>

<p>So they returned to the palace, which by this time was
crowded with courtiers, eager to kiss the hands of the Prince
and his bride. And the Prince whispered to one of his attendants,
who went out, and in a very little time came back with
Beauty's father and sisters.</p>

<p>The sisters were condemned to be changed into statues,
and to stand at the right and left of the palace gates until their
hearts should be softened, and they should be sorry for their
unkindness to their sister. But Beauty, happily married to
her Prince, went secretly to the statues every day and wept
over them.</p>

<p>And by her tears their stony hearts were softened, and they
were changed into flesh and blood again, and were good and
kind for the rest of their lives.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>[page&nbsp;335]</span>

<p>And Beauty and the Beast, who was a Beast no more, but
a handsome Prince, lived happily ever after.</p>

<p>And indeed I believe they are living happily still, in the
beautiful land where dreams come true.</p>

<h2>THE WHITE CAT</h2>

<h4>BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HERE</b> was once a King who had three sons, and because
they were all so good and so handsome, he could not make
up his mind to which of them to give his kingdom. For he
was growing an old man, and began to think it would soon be
time for him to let one of them reign in his stead.</p>

<p>So he determined to set them a task to perform, and whichever
should be the most successful was to have the kingdom
as his reward.</p>

<p>It was some time before he could decide what the task
should be. But at last he told them that he had a fancy for a
very beautiful little dog, and that they were all to set out to
find one for him. They were to have a whole year in which
to search, and were all to return to the castle on the same day,
and present the various dogs they had chosen at the same hour.</p>

<p>The three Princes were greatly surprised by their father's
sudden fancy for a little dog, but when they heard that whichever
of them brought back the prettiest little animal was to
succeed his father on the throne, they made no further objection,
for it gave the two younger sons a chance they would not otherwise
have had of being King.</p>

<p>So they bade their father good-bye, and after agreeing to
be back at the castle at the same hour, and on the same day,
when a year should have passed away, the three brothers all
started together.</p>

<p>A great number of lords and servants accompanied them out
<span class="left"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>[page&nbsp;336]</span>
of the city, but when they had ridden about a league they sent
everyone back, and after embracing one another affectionately,
they all set out to try their luck in different directions.</p>

<p>The two eldest met with many adventures on their travels,
but the youngest saw the most wonderful sights of all.</p>

<p>He was young and handsome, and as clever as a Prince should
be, besides being brave.</p>

<p>Wherever he went he enquired for dogs, and hardly a day
passed without his buying several, big and little, greyhounds,
spaniels, lap-dogs, and sheep-dogs&mdash;in fact, every kind of dog
that you could think of, and very soon he had a troop of fifty or
sixty trotting along behind him, one of which he thought would
surely win the prize.</p>

<p>So he journeyed on from day to day, not knowing where he
was going, until one night he lost his way in a thick dark forest,
and after wandering many weary miles in the wind and rain he
was glad to see at last a bright light shining through the trees.
He thought he must be near some woodcutter's cottage, but
what was his surprise when he found himself before the gateway
of a splendid castle!</p>


<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/0574.jpg"><img src="images/0574-316.jpg" width="316" height="450" alt="The Castle of the White Cat." border="0" /></a><br /><br />
<p class="center"><b>The Castle of the White Cat.</b></p>
</div>

<p>At first he hesitated about entering, for his garments were
travel stained, and he was drenched with rain, so that no one
could have possibly taken him for a Prince. All the beautiful
little dogs he had taken so much trouble to collect had been lost
in the forest, and he was thoroughly weary and disheartened.</p>

<p>However, something seemed to bid him enter the castle, so he
pulled the bell. Immediately the gateway flew open, and a
number of beautiful white hands appeared, and beckoned to
him to cross the courtyard and enter the great hall.</p>

<p>Here he found a splendid fire blazing, beside which stood a
comfortable arm-chair; the hands pointed invitingly towards it,
and as soon as the Prince had seated himself they proceeded to
take off his wet, muddy clothes, and dress him in a magnificent
suit of silk and velvet.</p>

<p>When he was ready, the hands led him into a brilliantly-lighted
room, in which was a table spread for supper. At the
end of the room was a raised platform, upon which a number of
cats were seated, all playing different musical instruments.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>[page&nbsp;337]</span>

<p>The Prince began to think he must be dreaming, when the
door opened, and a lovely little White Cat came in. She wore a
long black veil, and was accompanied by a number of cats,
dressed in black, and carrying swords.</p>

<p>She came straight up to the Prince, and in a sweet, sad little
voice bade him welcome. Then she ordered supper to be served,
and the whole company sat down together.</p>

<p>They were waited upon by the mysterious hands, but many
of the dishes were not to the Prince's liking. Stewed rats and
mice may be a first-rate meal for a cat, but the Prince did not
feel inclined to try them.</p>

<p>However, the White Cat ordered the hands to serve the Prince
with the dishes he liked best, and at once, without his even
mentioning his favorite food, he was supplied with every dainty
he could think of.</p>

<p>After the Prince had satisfied his hunger, he noticed that the
Cat wore a bracelet upon her paw, in which was set a miniature
of himself; but when he questioned her about it, she sighed, and
seemed so sad that, like a well-behaved Prince, he said no more
about the matter.</p>

<p>Soon after supper, the hands conducted him to bed, when he
at once fell fast asleep, and did not awaken until late the next
morning. On looking out of his window, he saw that the White
Cat and her attendants were about to start out on a hunting
expedition.</p>

<p>As soon as the hands had dressed him in a hunting-suit of
green, he hurried down to join his hostess.</p>

<p>The hands led him up to a wooden horse, and seemed to
expect him to mount. At first the Prince was inclined to be
angry, but the White Cat told him so gently that she had no
better steed to offer him, that he at once mounted, feeling very
much ashamed of his ill-humor.</p>

<p>They had an excellent day's sport. The White Cat, who
rode a monkey, proved herself a clever huntress, climbing the
tallest trees with the greatest ease, and without once falling from
her steed.</p>

<p>Never was there a pleasanter hunting party, and day after
day the time passed so happily away that the Prince forgot all
<span class="left"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>[page&nbsp;338]</span>
about the little dog he was searching for, and even forgot his
own home and his father's promise.</p>

<p>At length the White Cat reminded him that in three days he
must appear at court, and the Prince was terribly upset to think
that he had now no chance of winning his father's kingdom.
But the White Cat told him that all would be well, and giving
him an acorn, bade him mount the wooden horse and ride away.</p>

<p>The Prince thought she must be mocking him, but when she
held the acorn to his ear, he heard quite plainly a little dog's
bark.</p>

<p>"Inside this acorn," she said, "is the prettiest little dog in
the world. But be sure you do not open the fruit until you are
in the King's presence."</p>

<p>The Prince thanked her, and having bidden her a sorrowful
farewell, mounted his wooden steed and rode away.</p>

<p>Before he reached the castle, he met his two brothers, who
made fine fun of the wooden horse, and also of the big ugly dog
which trotted by his side.</p>

<p>They imagined this to be the one their brother had brought
back from his travels, hoping that it would gain the prize.</p>

<p>When they reached the palace, everyone was loud in praise
of the two lovely little dogs the elder brothers had brought back
with them, but when the youngest opened his acorn and showed
a tiny dog, lying upon a white satin cushion, they knew that this
must be the prettiest little dog in the world.</p>

<p>However, the King did not feel inclined to give up his throne
just yet, so he told the brothers that there was one more task
they must first perform: they must bring him a piece of muslin
so fine that it would pass through the eye of a needle.</p>

<p>So once more the brothers set out upon their travels. As
for the youngest, he mounted his wooden horse and rode straight
back to his dear White Cat.</p>

<p>She was delighted to welcome him, and when the Prince told
her that the King had now ordered him to find a piece of muslin
fine enough to go through the eye of a needle, she smiled at him
very sweetly, and told him to be of good cheer.</p>

<p>"In my palace I have some very clever spinners," she said;
"and I will set them to work upon the muslin."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>[page&nbsp;339]</span>

<p>The Prince had begun to suspect by this time that the White
Cat was no ordinary pussy, but whenever he begged her to tell
him her history, she only shook her head mournfully and sighed.</p>

<p>Well, the second year passed away as quickly as the first, and
the night before the day on which the three Princes were expected
at their father's court, the White Cat gave the young Prince a
walnut, telling him that it contained the muslin. Then she bade
him good-by, and he mounted the wooden horse and rode away.</p>

<p>This time the young Prince was so late that his brothers had
already begun to display their pieces of muslin to the King when
he arrived at the castle gates. The materials they had brought
were of extremely fine texture, and passed easily through the eye
of a darning-needle, but through the small needle the King had
provided they would <i>not</i> pass. Then the youngest Prince stepped
into the great hall and produced his walnut. He cracked it
carefully, and found inside a hazel-nut. This when cracked
held a cherrystone, inside the cherrystone was a grain of wheat,
and in the wheat a millet-seed. The Prince himself began to
mistrust the White Cat, but he instantly felt a cat's claw scratch
him gently, so he persevered, opened the millet-seed, and found
inside a beautiful piece of soft white muslin that was four hundred
ells long at the very least. It passed with the greatest ease
through the eye of the smallest needle in the kingdom, and the
Prince felt that now the prize must be his.</p>

<p>But the old King was still very loth to give up ruling, so he
told the Princes that before any one of them could become King
he must find a Princess to marry him who would be lovely
enough to grace her high station; and whichever of the Princes
brought home the most beautiful bride should <i>really</i> have the
kingdom for his own.</p>

<p>Of course, the Prince went back to the White Cat, and told
her how very unfairly his father had behaved to him. She
comforted him as best she could, and told him not to be afraid,
for she would introduce him to the loveliest Princess the sun had
ever shone upon.</p>

<p>The appointed time passed happily away, and one evening
the White Cat reminded the Prince that on the next day he must
return home.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>[page&nbsp;340]</span>
<p>
"Alas!" said he, "where shall I find a Princess now? The
time is so short that I cannot even look for one."</p>

<p>Then the White Cat told him that if only he would do as she
bade him all would be well.</p>

<p>"Take your sword, cut off my head and my tail, and cast
them into the flames," she said.</p>

<p>The Prince declared that on no account would he treat her so
cruelly; but she begged him so earnestly to do as she asked that
at last he consented.</p>

<p>No sooner had he cast the head and the tail into the fire than
a beautiful Princess appeared where the body of the cat had been.
The spell that had been cast upon her was broken, and at the
same time her courtiers and attendants, who had also been
changed into cats, hastened in in their proper forms again, to
pay their respects to their mistress.</p>

<p>The Prince at once fell deeply in love with the charming
Princess, and begged her to accompany him to his father's
court as his bride.</p>

<p>She consented, and together they rode away. During the
journey, the Princess told her husband the story of her enchantment.</p>

<a name="page340a" id="page340a"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/0575.jpg"><img src="images/0575-306.jpg" width="306" height="450" alt="She Was Happy All Day Long in Fairyland." border="0" /></a><br /><br />
<p class="center"><b>She Was Happy All Day Long in Fairyland.</b></p>
</div>


<p>She had been brought up by the fairies, who treated her with
great kindness until she offended them by falling in love with the
young man whose portrait the Prince had seen upon her paw,
and who exactly resembled him.</p>

<p>Now, the fairies wished her to marry the King of the Dwarfs,
and were so angry when she declared she would marry no one
but her own true love, that they changed her into a White Cat as
a punishment.</p>

<p>When the Prince and his bride reached the court, all were
bound to acknowledge that the Princess was by far the loveliest
lady they had ever seen.</p>

<p>So the poor old King felt that now he would be obliged to
give up his kingdom. But the Princess knelt by his side, kissed
his hand gently, and told him that there was no reason for him
to cease ruling, for she was rich enough to give a mighty kingdom
to each of his elder sons, and still have three left for herself and
her dear husband.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>[page&nbsp;341]</span>

<p>So everyone was pleased, and there was great rejoicing and
feasting in the King's palace, and they all lived happily ever after.</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF PRETTY GOLDILOCKS</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HERE</b> was once a Princess so lovely that no one could see
her without loving her. Her hair fell about her shoulders
in waving masses, and because it was the color of gold, she was
called Pretty Goldilocks. She always wore a crown of flowers,
and her dresses were embroidered with pearls and diamonds.</p>

<p>The fame of her beauty reached a young King, who determined
to marry her, although he had never seen her. He sent
an ambassador to ask her hand in marriage; and so confident
was he that the Princess would return with him, that he made
every preparation to receive her. The ambassador arrived at
the palace of the Princess with a hundred horses and as many
servants. With great ceremony, he presented the King's gifts of
pearls and diamonds, together with his message. The Princess,
however, did not favor the King's suit, and sent back his gifts
with a polite refusal. When the ambassador returned without
the Princess, every one blamed him for his failure; and the King's
disappointment was so great that no one could console him.</p>

<p>Now at the King's court was a young man so handsome
and clever that he was called Charming. Every one loved
him, except some who were envious because he was the King's
favorite. One day Charming rashly remarked that if the King
had sent <i>him</i> for the Princess, she would have come back with
him. His enemies at once went to the King and used the remark
to influence him against Charming.</p>

<p>"He thinks himself so handsome that the Princess could
not have resisted him, although she refused his King," they
told his Majesty.</p>

<p>The boastful words so offended the King that he ordered
Charming to be shut up in the tower, where he had only straw
<span class="left"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>[page&nbsp;342]</span>
to lie on and bread and water to eat. In this miserable state
he languished for some time, not knowing why he had been
imprisoned. One day the King happened to be passing the
tower and heard him exclaim:</p>

<p>"I am the King's most faithful subject; how have I incurred
his displeasure?" Then, in spite of the protests of Charming's
enemies, the King ordered the tower-door opened and Charming
brought forth. His old favorite sadly knelt and kissed his
hand, saying:</p>

<p>"Sire, how have I offended?"</p>

<p>The King told him of the boast his enemies had repeated.</p>

<p>"True, Sire, I did say that had I been sent to plead your
cause, it would not have failed for lack of eloquence. Could
the Princess see you as my tongue would picture you, I would
not return without her."</p>

<p>The King at once saw that he had been deceived, and restored
Charming to favor. While at supper that night, he
confided to him that he was as much in love with Goldilocks
as ever, and could not be reconciled to her answer.</p>

<p>"Do you think," asked the King, "that she could be induced
to change her mind?"</p>

<p>Charming replied that he was at the King's service and
willing to undertake the task of winning the Princess for him.
The King was delighted and offered him a splendid escort,
but he asked only for a good horse.</p>

<p>Early the next day he set forth, with a resolute heart and
the King's letter to the Princess. One day when he had ridden
a great distance, he dismounted and sat down under a tree that
grew beside a river. He took from his pocket a little book, in
which he jotted down some happy thoughts that he meant to
use in his plea to the Princess. Not far from where he sat,
a golden carp was springing from the water to catch flies, and
a bound too high landed it on the grass at Charming's feet.
It panted helplessly, and would have died had he not taken
pity on it and thrown it back into the river. It sank out of
sight, but presently returned to the surface long enough to
say:</p>

<p>"Thank you, Charming, for saving my life. Some day I
<span class="left"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>[page&nbsp;343]</span>
may repay you." Naturally, he was greatly surprised at so
much politeness from a fish.</p>

<p>A few days later, while riding along his way, he saw a raven
pursued by an eagle. In a moment more the eagle would
have overtaken the raven, had not Charming aimed his arrow
in time and killed the pursuer. The raven perched on a tree
near by and croaked its gratitude:</p>

<p>"You have rescued me from a dreadful fate," it said.
"Some day I will repay you."</p>

<p>A day or two afterward, in the dusk of early morning, he
heard the distressful cries of an owl. Hunting about, he found
the unfortunate bird caught in a net which some birdcatchers
had spread. "Why will men persecute and torment harmless
creatures!" exclaimed Charming, as he set the bird free. The
owl fluttered above his head, saying:</p>

<p>"You have saved me from the fowlers, who would have killed
me. I am not ungrateful, and some day I will repay you!"
After that it flew swiftly away.</p>

<p>Charming at last reached the palace of the Princess, and
asked an audience. His name so pleased her that she at once
received him. He was ushered into the presence of the Princess,
who sat on a throne of gold and ivory. Her satin dress was
embroidered with jewels, and her golden hair was confined by
a crown of flowers. Soft music and perfume filled the air,
and Charming was so awed by all this splendor that at first he
could not speak. Recovering himself in a moment, he told of
his mission, and set forth the good qualities of the King in
such glowing terms that the Princess listened.</p>

<p>"You have argued so eloquently," replied she, "that I
regret to deny you; but I have made a vow not to marry, until
the ambassador can return to me a ring which I lost in the
river a month ago. I valued it more than all my other
jewels, and nothing but its recovery can persuade me to your
suit."</p>

<p>Charming could urge no more, but offered an embroidered
scarf and his little dog Frisk as tokens of devotion. These
were declined, so bowing low, he reluctantly took leave of the
Princess. He believed that she had but used this means to
<span class="left"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>[page&nbsp;344]</span>
put him off, and his disappointment was so great that he could
not sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning he and Frisk were walking by the riverside
when the dog ran to the water's edge, barking furiously. Joining
the little animal, he saw that his excitement was caused by
a golden carp which came swimming swiftly toward them.
In its mouth was a beautiful ring which it laid in Charming's
hand.</p>

<p>"You saved my life by the willow-tree," said the carp,
"and I now repay you by giving to you the Princess's ring."</p>

<p>Charming lost no time in presenting it to the Princess and
claiming his reward.</p>

<p>"What fairy aids you?" asked the Princess.</p>

<p>"Only my wish to serve you," Charming replied.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the Princess, "I cannot marry until Galifron,
the giant, is dead. Because I would not take him for my husband,
he persecutes my subjects and lays waste my land."</p>

<p>"Princess, I will bring back the giant's head to you or die
in your defense," bravely declared Charming.</p>

<p>The Princess and all the people tried to dissuade him, but
he mounted his horse and rode off, accompanied only by his
little dog, Frisk. He traveled straight to the giant's castle.
All about it were strewn the bones of Galifron's victims. Inside
the castle the giant was singing in a terrible voice:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Little children I love to eat;</p>
<p>Their bones are tender, their flesh is sweet.</p>
<p>I do not care, I eat so many,</p>
<p>If their hair be straight, or if they haven't any."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Charming called out loudly in reply:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Be not so boastful, Galifron,</p>
<p>Till you've met a knight, who</p>
<p>May be good to feed upon,</p>
<p>But is here to fight you."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The giant appeared at the door, club in hand. When he
saw Charming fearlessly awaiting him, he came toward him
in a terrible rage. But before he could wield his club, a raven
lit on his head and pecked at his eyes, so that he dropped his
weapon and was at Charming's mercy. When the valiant
<span class="left"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>[page&nbsp;345]</span>
knight had killed the giant, the raven croaked from a tree near
by:</p>

<p>"You saved me from the eagle, and I in turn have saved
you from the giant."</p>

<p>Charming cut off the head of the giant, and carried it back
with him to the Princess. Then the people shouted until they
were hoarse, and welcomed him as a great hero.</p>

<p>"Your enemy is dead," Charming told the Princess. "Will
you now make my master the happiest of kings?"</p>

<p>"There is," replied the reluctant Princess, "some water
which gives eternal health and beauty to those who drink it.
I would regret to leave my kingdom without possessing some
of it; but no one has dared to brave the two dragons that guard
the cavern where the fountain is to be found."</p>

<p>"You do not need the water, Princess; but my life is yours
to command," gallantly replied Charming; and he set out at
once on the perilous mission.</p>

<p>When he came to the mouth of the cavern, black smoke
issued forth; and presently he perceived the terrible form of a
dragon, from whose mouth and eyes fire was darting. Bidding
good-by to faithful Frisk, he grasped his sword in one hand
and the crystal flask which the Princess had given him in the
other. Just then he heard his name called twice, and, looking
back, he saw an owl flying toward him.</p>

<p>"I can enter the gloomy cavern without danger," the owl
said. "Give the flask to me, and I will repay the debt I owe
you for having saved me from the net."</p>

<p>Charming gladly surrendered the flask to the owl, who in
a short time returned it to him filled with the precious water.</p>

<p>The Princess this time consented to marry the King, and
after many preparations she and Charming started for his
kingdom. The journey was made so entertaining for the
Princess that she one day said to Charming:</p>

<p>"Why did I not make you King, and remain in my own
country?" Charming replied that he must have considered
his duty to his King, even before a happiness so great.</p>

<p>The King, with presents of rich jewels and a splendid escort,
met them on the way to the palace. The marriage was
<span class="left"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>[page&nbsp;346]</span>
celebrated with great pomp, and Charming stood first in the
King's favor. His good fortune, however, did not continue
long, for envious enemies pointed out to the King that the
Princess was never happy unless Charming was near. The
unhappy knight was again put into prison, where he was cruelly
chained and fed on bread and water.</p>

<p>When Goldilocks learned this, she wept and implored the
King to set him free. "But for him I never would have been
here," she said. "Did he not perform every task I required,
even that of getting for me the water whereby I shall never
grow old?"</p>

<p>The Princess's grief only made the King more jealous, but
he determined to make use of this wonderful water of which
she had told. It so happened that one of the Princess's ladies
had broken the crystal flask and spilled all of the water. Not
daring to confess, she put another in its place that exactly
resembled it in appearance. This, however, contained a deadly
poison. When the King bathed his face with it, he fell into a
sleep from which he never awoke.</p>

<p>There was great confusion in the palace when the King was
found dead. Frisk ran immediately to Charming and told him
the news. In a short time Goldilocks also appeared, unlocked
his chains, and set him free.</p>

<p>"You shall be my husband," said she, "and I will make
you King."</p>

<p>Charming fell at her feet and expressed his gratitude and
joy. They were married soon afterward, and they reigned
together for many happy years.</p>

<h2>TOADS AND DIAMONDS</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">A</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>BAD-TEMPERED</b> widow had two daughters. The eldest
was like her mother, both in feature and disposition, while
the youngest resembled her father. She was sweet-natured
always, and as pretty as she was amiable.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>[page&nbsp;347]</span>

<p>The widow doted on the daughter who was so like herself,
but had no love for the other, whom she compelled to work hard
all day, and to live upon the leavings of her elder sister. Among
her other hard tasks, she was obliged to carry water every day
from a great distance.</p>

<p>One day when she had just filled her pitcher at the fountain,
an old woman asked to drink from it. "With all my heart,"
replied the pretty girl. Glad to show a kindness to one old
and infirm, she held the pitcher while the woman slaked her
thirst.</p>

<p>Now, this was not a trembling old peasant, as she appeared,
but a fairy who rewarded good deeds. "Your face is pretty
and your heart is gentle," said she. "For your kindness to a
poor old woman, I will make you a gift. Every time you speak,
from your mouth shall come a flower or a jewel."</p>

<p>When the girl reached home her mother scolded her for her
long absence. "Pardon me for being away so long," she
sweetly replied. As she spoke some pearls and diamonds issued
from her lips.</p>

<p>"What is this I see, child?" asked the astonished widow.</p>

<p>The forlorn girl was so happy to be called child by her
mother that she eagerly related her experience with the old
woman at the fountain, while, with her words, dropped precious
stones and roses. The widow immediately called her favorite
daughter to her.</p>

<p>"Fanny, wouldst thou have the same gift as thy sister?"
asked she. "Go thou to the fountain and fetch water. And
if an old woman asks thee for a drink, mind thou treat her
civilly."</p>

<p>The girl refused to perform the menial task, until the widow
lost patience and drove her to it. Finally, she took the silver
tankard and sullenly obeyed. No sooner was she at the fountain
than from the wood came a lady most handsomely attired, who
asked the haughty girl for a drink from her pitcher.</p>

<p>"I have not come here to serve you," she rudely replied,
"but take the pitcher and help yourself, for all I care. I would
have you know that I am as good as you."</p>

<p>The lady was the fairy, who had taken the appearance of a
<span class="left"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>[page&nbsp;348]</span>
princess to see how far the girl's insolence would go. "I will
make you a gift," she said, "to equal your discourtesy and ill
breeding. Every time you speak, there shall come from your
mouth a snake or a toad."</p>

<p>The girl ran home to her mother, who met her at the door.
"Well, daughter," she said, impatient to hear her speak.
When she opened her mouth, to the mother's horror, two vipers
and two toads sprang from it. "This is the fault of your
wretched sister," the unhappy mother cried. She ran to beat
the poor younger sister, who fled to the forest to escape the
cruel blows. When she was past pursuit, she threw herself
upon the green grass and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>The King's son, returning from the hunt, found her thus,
and asked the cause of her tears.</p>

<p>"My mother has driven me from my home," she told him.
She was so pretty that he fell in love with her at once, and pressed
her to tell him more. She then related to him the whole story,
while pearls and diamonds kept falling from her lips. Enraptured,
he took her to the King, who gave his consent to their
immediate marriage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the ugly and selfish sister had made herself so
disagreeable that even her own mother turned against her.
She, too, was driven forth into the forest, where she died miserable
and alone.</p>

<h2>THE HISTORY OF TOM THUMB</h2>

<h4>ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">I</span></p>
<p><b>T</b> is said that in the days of the famed Prince Arthur, who
was king of Britain, in the year 516 there lived a great
magician, called Merlin, the most learned and skilful enchanter
in the world at that time.</p>

<p>This great magician, who could assume any form he pleased,
was traveling in the disguise of a poor beggar, and being very
much fatigued, he stopped at the cottage of an honest plowman
to rest himself, and ask for some refreshment.</p>

<p>The countryman gave him a hearty welcome, and his wife,
who was a very good-hearted, hospitable woman, soon brought
him some milk in a wooden bowl, and some coarse brown bread
on a platter.</p>

<p>Merlin was much pleased with this homely repast and the
kindness of the plowman and his wife; but he could not help
seeing that though everything was neat and comfortable in the
cottage, they seemed both to be sad and much cast down. He
therefore questioned them on the cause of their sadness, and
learned that they were miserable because they had no children.</p>

<p>The poor woman declared, with tears in her eyes, that she
should be the happiest creature in the world if she had a son;
and although he was no bigger than her husband's thumb, she
would be satisfied.</p>

<p>Merlin was so much amused with the idea of a boy no bigger
than a man's thumb, that he made up his mind to pay a visit to
the queen of the fairies, and ask her to grant the poor woman's
wish. The droll fancy of such a little person among the human
race pleased the fairy queen too, greatly, and she promised
Merlin that the wish should be granted. Accordingly, in a
<span class="left"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>[page&nbsp;350]</span>
short time after, the plowman's wife had a son, who, wonderful
to relate, was not a bit bigger than his father's thumb.</p>

<p>The fairy queen, wishing to see the little fellow thus born
into the world, came in at the window while the mother was
sitting up in bed admiring him. The queen kissed the child,
and giving it the name of Tom Thumb, sent for some of the
fairies, who dressed her little favorite as she bade them.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"An oak-leaf hat he had for his crown;</p>
<p>His shirt of web by spiders spun;</p>
<p>With jacket wove of thistle's down;</p>
<p>His trousers were of feathers done.</p>
<p>His stockings, of apple-rind, they tie</p>
<p>With eyelash from his mother's eye:</p>
<p>His shoes were made of mouses' skin,</p>
<p>Tann'd with the downy hair within."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>It is remarkable that Tom never grew any larger than his
father's thumb, which was only of an ordinary size; but as he
got older he became very cunning and full of tricks. When he
was old enough to play with the boys, and had lost all his own
cherry-stones, he used to creep into the bags of his playfellows,
fill his pockets, and, getting out unseen, would again join in the
game.</p>

<p>One day, however, as he was coming out of a bag of cherry-stones,
where he had been pilfering as usual, the boy to whom it
belonged chanced to see him. "Ah, ha! my little Tommy,"
said the boy, "so I have caught you stealing my cherry-stones
at last, and you shall be rewarded for your thievish tricks."
On saying this, he drew the string tight round his neck, and
gave the bag such a hearty shake, that poor little Tom's legs,
thighs, and body were sadly bruised. He roared out with the
pain, and begged to be let out, promising never to be guilty of
such bad practices again.</p>

<p>A short time afterwards his mother was making a batter
pudding, and Tom being very anxious to see how it was made,
climbed up to the edge of the bowl; but unfortunately his foot
slipped and he plumped over head and ears into the batter,
unseen by his mother, who stirred him into the pudding-bag,
and put him in the pot to boil.</p>

<p>The batter had filled Tom's mouth, and prevented him from
<span class="left"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>[page&nbsp;351]</span>
crying; but, on feeling the hot water, he kicked and struggled
so much in the pot, that his mother thought that the pudding
was bewitched, and, instantly pulling it out of the pot, she
threw it to the door. A poor tinker, who was passing by,
lifted up the pudding, and, putting it into his budget, he then
walked off. As Tom had now got his mouth cleared of the
batter, he then began to cry aloud, which so frightened the
tinker that he flung down the pudding and ran away. The
pudding being broke to pieces by the fall, Tom crept out covered
over with the batter, and with difficulty walked home.
His mother, who was very sorry to see her darling in such a
woful state, put him into a tea-cup, and soon washed off the
batter; after which she kissed him, and laid him in bed.</p>

<p>Soon after the adventure of the pudding, Tom's mother
went to milk her cow in the meadow, and she took him along
with her. As the wind was very high, fearing lest he should
be blown away, she tied him to a thistle with a piece of fine
thread. The cow soon saw the oak-leaf hat, and, liking the
look of it, took poor Tom and the thistle at one mouthful.
While the cow was chewing the thistle Tom was afraid of her
great teeth, which threatened to crush him to pieces, and he
roared out as loud as he could, "Mother, mother!"</p>

<p>"Where are you, Tommy, my dear Tommy?" said his
mother.</p>

<p>"Here, mother," replied he, "in the cow's mouth."</p>

<p>His mother began to cry and wring her hands; but the cow,
surprised at the odd noise in her throat, opened her mouth and
let Tom drop out. Fortunately his mother caught him in her
apron as he was falling to the ground, or he would have been
dreadfully hurt. She then put Tom in her bosom and ran home
with him.</p>

<p>Tom's father made him a whip of a barley straw to drive
the cattle with, and having one day gone into the fields, he slipped
a foot and rolled into the furrow. A raven, which was flying
over, picked him up, and flew with him to the top of a giant's
castle that was near the sea-side, and there left him.</p>

<p>Tom was in a dreadful state, and did not know what to do;
but he was soon more dreadfully frightened; for old Grumbo
<span class="left"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>[page&nbsp;352]</span>
the giant came up to walk on the terrace, and seeing Tom, he
took him up and swallowed him like a pill.</p>

<p>The giant had no sooner swallowed Tom than he began to
repent what he hand done; for Tom began to kick and jump
about so much that he felt very uncomfortable, and at last
threw him up again into the sea. A large fish swallowed Tom
the moment he fell into the sea, which was soon after caught,
and bought for the table of King Arthur. When they opened
the fish in order to cook it, everyone was astonished at finding
such a little boy, and Tom was quite delighted to be out again.
They carried him to the King, who made Tom his dwarf, and
he soon grew a great favorite at court; for by his tricks and
gambols he not only amused the King and Queen, but also
all the Knights of the Round Table.</p>

<p>It is said that when the King rode out on horseback, he often
took Tom along with him, and if a shower came on, he used to
creep into his Majesty's waistcoat pocket, where he slept till
the rain was over.</p>

<p>King Arthur one day asked Tom about his parents, wishing
to know if they were as small as he was, and whether rich or
poor. Tom told the King that his father and mother were as
tall as any of the sons about court, but rather poor. On hearing
this, the King carried Tom to his treasury, the place where
he kept all his money, and told him to take as much money as
he could carry home to his parents, which made the poor little
fellow caper with joy. Tom went immediately to fetch a purse,
which was made of a water-bubble, and then returned to the
treasury, where he got a silver three-penny piece to put into it.</p>

<p>Our little hero had some trouble in lifting the burden upon his
back; but he at last succeeded in getting it placed to his mind,
and set forward on his journey. However, without meeting
with any accident and after resting himself more than a hundred
times by the way, in two days and two nights he reached
his father's house in safety.</p>

<p>Tom had traveled forty-eight hours with a huge silver-piece
on his back, and was almost tired to death, when his mother
ran out to meet him, and carried him into the house.</p>

<p>Tom's parents were both happy to see him, and the more so
<span class="left"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>[page&nbsp;353]</span>
as he had brought such an amazing sum of money with him;
but the poor little fellow was excessively wearied, having traveled
half a mile in forty-eight hours, with a huge silver threepenny-piece
on his back. His mother, in order to recover him, placed
him in a walnut shell by the fireside, and feasted him for three
days on a hazel-nut, which made him very sick; for a whole
nut used to serve him a month.</p>

<p>Tom was soon well again; but as there had been a fall of
rain, and the ground was very wet, he could not travel back
to King Arthur's Court; therefore his mother, one day when the
wind was blowing in that direction, made a little parasol of
cambric paper, and tying Tom to it, she gave him a puff into
the air with her mouth, which soon carried him to the King's
palace.</p>

<p>Just at the time when Tom came flying across the courtyard,
the cook happened to be passing with the King's great
bowl of porridge, which was a dish his Majesty was very fond
of; but unfortunately the poor little fellow fell plump into the
middle of it, and splashed the hot porridge about the cook's
face.</p>

<p>The cook, who was an ill-natured fellow, being in a terrible
rage at Tom for frightening and scalding him with the porridge,
went straight to the King, and said that Tom had jumped into
the royal porridge, and thrown it down out of mere mischief.
The King was so enraged when he heard this, that he ordered
Tom to be seized and tried for high treason; and there being
no person who dared to plead for him, he was condemned to be
beheaded immediately.</p>

<p>On hearing this dreadful sentence pronounced, poor Tom
fell a-trembling with fear, but, seeing no means of escape, and
observing a miller close to him gaping with his great mouth,
as country boobies do at a fair, he took a leap, and fairly jumped
down his throat. This exploit was done with such activity
that not one person present saw it, and even the miller did not
know the trick which Tom had played upon him. Now, as
Tom had disappeared, the court broke up, and the miller went
home to his mill.</p>

<p>When Tom heard the mill at work he knew he was clear
<span class="left"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>[page&nbsp;354]</span>
of the court, and therefore he began to roll and tumble about,
so that the poor miller could get no rest, thinking he was bewitched;
so he sent for a doctor. When the doctor came,
Tom began to dance and sing; and the doctor, being as much
frightened as the miller, sent in haste for five other doctors and
twenty learned men.</p>

<p>When they were debating about this extraordinary case,
the miller happened to yawn, when Tom, seizing the chance,
made another jump, and alighted safely upon his feet on the
middle of the table.</p>

<p>The miller, who was very much provoked at being tormented
by such a little pigmy creature, fell into a terrible rage,
and, laying hold of Tom, ran to the King with him; but his
Majesty, being engaged with state affairs, ordered him to be
taken away, and kept in custody till he sent for him.</p>

<p>The cook was determined that Tom should not slip out
of his hands this time, so he put him into a mouse-trap, and
left him to peep through the wires. Tom had remained in
the trap a whole week, when he was sent for by King Arthur,
who pardoned him for throwing down the porridge, and took
him again into favor. On account of his wonderful feats of
activity, Tom was knighted by the King, and went under the
name of the renowned Sir Thomas Thumb. As Tom's clothes
had suffered much in the batter-pudding, the porridge, and the insides
of the giant, miller, and fishes, his Majesty ordered him a
new suit of clothes, and to be mounted as a knight.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Of Butterfly's wings his shirt was made,</p>
<p class="i2">His boots of chicken's hide;</p>
<p>And by a nimble fairy blade,</p>
<p>Well learned in the tailoring trade,</p>
<p class="i2">His clothing was supplied&mdash;</p>
<p>A needle dangled by his side;</p>
<p>A dapper mouse he used to ride,</p>
<p>Thus strutted Tom in stately pride!"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>It was certainly very diverting to see Tom in this dress,
and mounted on the mouse, as he rode out a-hunting with the
King and nobility, who were all ready to expire with laughter
at Tom and his fine prancing charger.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>[page&nbsp;355]</span>

<p>One day, as they were riding by a farmhouse, a large cat,
which was lurking about the door, made a spring, and seized
both Tom and his mouse. She then ran up a tree with them,
and was beginning to devour the mouse; but Tom boldly drew
his sword, and attacked the cat so fiercely that she let them both
fall, when one of the nobles caught him in his hat, and laid him
on a bed of down, in a little ivory cabinet.</p>

<p>The queen of the fairies came soon after to pay Tom a visit,
and carried him back to Fairyland, where he lived several
years. During his residence there, King Arthur, and all the
persons who knew Tom, had died; and as he was desirous of
being again at court, the fairy queen, after dressing him in a
suit of clothes, sent him flying through the air to the palace,
in the days of King Thunstone, the successor of Arthur. Every
one flocked round to see him, and being carried to the King, he
was asked who he was&mdash;whence he came&mdash;and where he lived?
Tom answered:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">"My name is Tom Thumb,</p>
<p class="i6">From the fairies I've come.</p>
<p class="i6">When King Arthur shone,</p>
<p class="i6">His Court was my home.</p>
<p class="i6">In me he delighted,</p>
<p class="i6">By him I was knighted;</p>
<p>Did you never hear of Sir Thomas Thumb?"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The King was so charmed with this address that he ordered
a little chair to be made, in order that Tom might sit upon his
table, and also a palace of gold, a span high, with a door an
inch wide, to live in. He also gave him a coach, drawn by six
small mice.</p>

<p>The Queen was so enraged at the honor paid to Sir Thomas
that she resolved to ruin him, and told the King that the little
knight had been saucy to her.</p>

<p>The King sent for Tom in great haste, but being fully aware
of the danger of royal anger, he crept into an empty snail-shell,
where he lay for a long time, until he was almost starved with
hunger; but at last he ventured to peep out, and seeing a fine
large butterfly on the ground, near his hiding-place, he approached
very cautiously, and getting himself placed astride
on it, was immediately carried up into the air. The butterfly
flew with him from tree to tree and from field to field, and at
<span class="left"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>[page&nbsp;356]</span>
last he returned to the court, where the King and nobility all
strove to catch him; but at last poor Tom fell from his seat into
a watering-pot, in which he was almost drowned.</p>

<p>When the Queen saw him she was in a rage, and said he
should be beheaded; and he was again put into a mouse-trap
until the time of his execution.</p>

<p>However, a cat, observing something alive in the trap,
patted it about till the wires broke, and set Thomas at liberty.</p>

<p>The King received Tom again into favor, which he did not
live to enjoy, for a large spider one day attacked him; and
although he drew his sword and fought well, yet the spider's
poisonous breath at last overcame him:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"He fell dead on the ground where he stood,</p>
<p>And the spider suck'd every drop of his blood."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>King Thunstone and his whole court were so sorry at the
loss of their little favorite, that they went into mourning, and
raised a fine white marble monument over his grave, with the
following epitaph:</p>
<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Here lies Tom Thumb, King Arthur's knight,</p>
<p>Who died by a spider's cruel bite.</p>
<p>He was well known in Arthur's Court,</p>
<p>Where he afforded gallant sport;</p>
<p>He rode at tilt and tournament,</p>
<p>And on a mouse a-hunting went.</p>
<p>Alive he filled the Court with mirth;</p>
<p>His death to sorrow soon gave birth.</p>
<p>Wipe, wipe your eyes, and shake your head</p>
<p>And cry&mdash;Alas! Tom Thumb is dead!"</p>

<h2>JACK THE GIANT-KILLER</h2>


<h4>ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">W</span></p>
<p><b>HEN</b> good King Arthur reigned, there lived near the
Land's End of England, in the county of Cornwall, a
farmer who had one only son called Jack. He was brisk and of
ready, lively wit, so that nobody or nothing could worst him.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>[page&nbsp;357]</span>
<p>
In those days the Mount of Cornwall was kept by a huge
giant named Cormoran. He was eighteen feet in height, and
about three yards round the waist, of a fierce and grim countenance,
the terror of all the neighboring towns and villages.
He lived in a cave in the midst of the Mount, and whenever
he wanted food he would wade over to the mainland, where
he would furnish himself with whatever came in his way.
Everybody at his approach ran out of their houses, while he
seized on their cattle, making nothing of carrying half-a-dozen
oxen on his back at a time; and as for their sheep and hogs,
he would tie them round his waist like a bunch of tallow-dips.
He had done this for many years, so that all Cornwall was in
despair.</p>

<p>One day Jack happened to be at the town hall when the
magistrates were sitting in council about the giant. He asked,
"What reward will be given to the man who kills Cormoran?"
"The giant's treasure," they said, "will be the reward." Quoth
Jack, "Then let me undertake it."</p>

<p>So he got a horn, shovel, and pickaxe, and went over to the
Mount in the beginning of a dark winter's evening, when he
fell to work, and before morning had dug a pit twenty-two feet
deep, and nearly as broad, covering it over with long sticks
and straw. Then he strewed a little mold over it, so that it
appeared like plain ground. Jack then placed himself on the
opposite side of the pit, farthest from the giant's lodging, and,
just at the break of day, he put the horn to his mouth, and
blew. This noise roused the giant, who rushed from his cave,
crying: "You incorrigible villain, are you come here to disturb
my rest? You shall pay dearly for this. Satisfaction I will
have, and this it shall be, I will take you whole and broil you
for breakfast." He had no sooner uttered this, than he tumbled
into the pit, and made the very foundations of the Mount
to shake. "Oh Giant," quoth Jack, "where are you now?
Oh, faith, you are gotten now into a tight place, where I will
surely plague you for your threatening words; what do you
think now of broiling me for your breakfast? Will no other
diet serve you but poor Jack?" Then having tantalized the
giant for a while, he gave him a most weighty knock with his
<span class="left"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>[page&nbsp;358]</span>
pickaxe on the very crown of his head, and killed him on the
spot.</p>

<p>Jack then filled up the pit with earth, and went to search
the cave, which he found contained much treasure. When
the magistrates heard of this they made a declaration he should
henceforth be termed:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><b>JACK THE GIANT-KILLER</b></p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>and presented him with a sword and a belt, on which were
written these words embroidered in letters of gold:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"<b>Here's the right valiant Cornish man.</b></p>
<p><b>Who slew the giant Cormoran.</b>"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/0576.jpg"><img src="images/0576-450.jpg" width="450" height="294" alt="This is the Valiant Cornishman Who Slew the Giant Cormoran." border="0" /></a><br /><br />
<p class="center"><b>This is the Valiant Cornishman Who Slew the Giant Cormoran.</b></p>
</div>

<p>The news of Jack's victory soon spread over all the West
of England, so that another giant, named Blunderbore, hearing
of it, vowed to be revenged on Jack, if ever he should light on
him. This giant was the lord of an enchanted castle situated
in the midst of a lonesome wood. Now Jack, about four
months afterwards, walking near this wood in his journey to
Wales, being weary, seated himself near a pleasant fountain
and fell fast asleep. While he was sleeping, the giant, coming
there for water, discovered him, and knew him to be the far-famed
Jack the Giant-killer by the lines written on the belt.
Without ado, he took Jack on his shoulders and carried him
towards his castle. Now, as they passed through a thicket,
the rustling of the boughs awakened Jack, who was strangely
surprised to find himself in the clutches of the giant. His
terror was only begun, for, on entering the castle, he saw the
ground strewed with human bones, and the giant told him his
own would ere long be among them. After this the giant
locked poor Jack in an immense chamber, leaving him there
while he went to fetch another giant, his brother, living in the
same wood, who might share in the meal on Jack.</p>

<p>After waiting some time Jack, on going to the window
beheld afar off the two giants coming towards the castle. "Now,"
quoth Jack to himself, "my death or my deliverance is at hand."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>[page&nbsp;359]</span>

<p>Now, there were strong cords in a corner of the room in which
Jack was, and two of these he took, and made a strong noose
at the end; and while the giants were unlocking the iron gate
of the castle he threw the ropes over each of their heads. Then
he drew the other ends across a beam, and pulled with all his
might, so that he throttled them. Then, when he saw they
were black in the face, he slid down the rope, and drawing
his sword, slew them both. Then, taking the giant's keys,
and unlocking the rooms, he found three fair ladies tied by the
hair of their heads, almost starved to death. "Sweet ladies,"
quoth Jack, "I have destroyed this monster and his brutish
brother, and obtained your liberty." This said he presented
them with the keys, and so proceeded on his journey to Wales.</p>

<p>Jack made the best of his way by traveling as fast as he
could, but lost his road, and was benighted, and could find no
habitation until, coming into a narrow valley, he found a large
house, and in order to get shelter took courage to knock at the
gate. But what was his surprise when there came forth a
monstrous giant with two heads; yet he did not appear so
fiery as the others were, for he was a Welsh giant, and what he
did was by private and secret malice under the false show of
friendship. Jack, having told his condition to the giant, was
shown into a bedroom, where, in the dead of night, he heard
his host in another apartment muttering these words:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Though here you lodge with me this night,</p>
<p>You shall not see the morning light:</p>
<p>My club shall dash your brains outright!"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>"Say'st thou so," quoth Jack; "that is like one of your
Welsh tricks, yet I hope to be cunning enough for you." Then,
getting out of bed, he laid a log in the bed in his stead, and hid
himself in a corner of the room. At the dead time of the night
in came the Welsh giant, who struck several heavy blows on
the bed with his club, thinking he had broken every bone in
Jack's skin. The next morning Jack, laughing in his sleeve,
gave him hearty thanks for his night's lodging. "How have
you rested?" quoth the giant; "did you not feel anything in
the night?" "No," quoth Jack, "nothing but a rat, which
<span class="left"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>[page&nbsp;360]</span>
gave me two or three slaps with her tail." With that, greatly
wondering, the giant led Jack to breakfast, bringing him a
bowl containing four gallons of hasty pudding. Being loth to
let the giant think it too much for him, Jack put a large leather
bag under his loose coat, in such a way that he could convey
the pudding into it without its being perceived. Then, telling
the giant he would show him a trick, taking a knife, Jack ripped
open the bag, and out came all the hasty pudding. Whereupon,
saying, "Odds splutters her nails, her can do that trick herself,"
the monster took the knife, and ripping open his belly, fell down
dead.</p>

<p>Now, it happened in these days that King Arthur's only
son asked his father to give him a large sum of money, in order
that he might go and seek his fortune in the principality of
Wales, where lived a beautiful lady possessed with seven evil
spirits. The King did his best to persuade his son from it, but
in vain; so at last gave way and the Prince set out with two
horses, one loaded with money, the other for himself to ride
upon. Now, after several days' travel, he came to a market-town
in Wales, where he beheld a vast crowd of people gathered
together. The Prince asked the reason of it, and was told that
they had arrested a corpse for several large sums of money
which the deceased owed when he died. The Prince replied
that it was a pity creditors should be so cruel, and said, "Go
bury the dead, and let his creditors come to my lodging, and
there their debts shall be paid." They came, in such great
numbers that before night he had only twopence left for himself.</p>

<p>Now Jack the Giant-killer, coming that way, was so taken
with the generosity of the Prince, that he desired to be his servant.
This being agreed upon, the next morning they set
forward on their journey together, when, as they were riding
out of the town, an old woman called after the Prince, saying,
"He has owed me twopence these seven years; pray pay me
as well as the rest." Putting his hand into his pocket, the Prince
gave the woman all he had left, so that after their day's food,
which cost what small store Jack had by him, they were without
a penny between them.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>[page&nbsp;361]</span>
<p>
When the sun got low, the King's son said, "Jack, since
we have no money, where can we lodge this night?"</p>

<p>But Jack replied, "Master, we'll do well enough, for I
have an uncle lives within two miles of this place; he is a huge
and monstrous giant with three heads; he'll fight five hundred
men in armor, and make them to fly before him."</p>

<p>"Alas!" quoth the Prince, "what shall we do there? He'll
certainly chop us up at a mouthful. Nay, we are scarce enough
to fill one of his hollow teeth!"</p>

<p>"It is no matter for that," quoth Jack; "I myself will go
before and prepare the way for you; therefore stop here and
wait till I return." Jack then rode away at full speed, and
coming to the gate of the castle, he knocked so loud that he
made the neighboring hills resound. The giant roared out at
this like thunder, "Who's there?"</p>

<p>Jack answered, "None but your poor cousin Jack."</p>

<p>Quoth he, "What news with my poor cousin Jack?"</p>

<p>He replied, "Dear uncle, bad news, God willing!"</p>

<p>"Prithee," quoth the giant, "what bad news can come to
me? I am a giant with three heads, and besides thou knowest
I can fight five hundred men in armor, and make them fly
like chaff before the wind."</p>

<p>"Oh, but," quoth Jack, "here's the King's son a-coming with a
thousand men in armor to kill you and destroy all that you have!"</p>

<p>"Oh, cousin Jack," said the giant, "this is bad news
indeed! I will immediately run and hide myself, and thou
shalt lock, bolt, and bar me in, and keep the keys until the
Prince is gone." Having secured the giant, Jack fetched his
master, when they made themselves heartily merry whilst the
poor giant lay trembling in a vault under the ground.</p>

<p>Early in the morning Jack furnished his master with a
fresh supply of gold and silver, and then sent him three miles
forward on his journey, at which time the Prince was pretty
well out of the smell of the giant. Jack then returned, and
let the giant out of the vault, who asked what he should give
him for keeping the castle from destruction. "Why," quoth
Jack, "I want nothing but the old coat and cap, together with
the old rusty sword and slippers which are at your bed's head."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>[page&nbsp;362]</span>

<p>Quoth the giant: "You know not what you ask; they are the
most precious things I have. The coat will keep you invisible,
the cap will tell you all you want to know, the sword cuts
asunder whatever you strike, and the shoes are of extraordinary
swiftness. But you have been very serviceable to me, therefore
take them with all my heart." Jack thanked his uncle, and
then went off with them. He soon overtook his master and
they quickly arrived at the house of the lady the Prince sought,
who, finding the Prince to be a suitor, prepared a splendid banquet
for him. After the repast was concluded, she told him she
had a task for him. She wiped his mouth with a handkerchief,
saying, "You must show me that handkerchief to-morrow
morning, or else you will lose your head." With that she put
it in her bosom. The Prince went to bed in great sorrow, but
Jack's cap of knowledge informed him how it was to be obtained.
In the middle of the night she called upon her familiar spirit
to carry her to Lucifer. But Jack put on his coat of darkness
and his shoes of swiftness, and was there as soon as she was.
When she entered the place of the demon, she gave the handkerchief
to him, and he laid it upon a shelf, whence Jack took
it and brought it to his master, who showed it to the lady next
day, and so saved his life. On that day, she gave the Prince a
kiss and told him he must show her the lips to-morrow morning
that she kissed last night, or lose his head.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he replied, "if you kiss none but mine, I will."</p>

<p>"That is neither here nor there," said she; "if you do not,
death's your portion!"</p>

<p>At midnight she went as before, and was angry with the
demon for letting the handkerchief go. "But now," quoth she,
"I will be too hard for the King's son, for I will kiss thee and he
is to show me thy lips." Which she did, and Jack, when she was
not standing by, cut off Lucifer's head and, brought it under his
invisible coat to his master, who the next morning pulled it out
by the horns before the lady. This broke the enchantment and
the evil spirit left her, and she appeared in all her beauty.
They were married the next morning, and soon after went to
the Court of King Arthur, where Jack for his many great exploits,
was made one of the Knights of the Round Table.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page363" id="page363"></a>[page&nbsp;363]</span>

<p>Jack soon went searching for giants again, but he had not
ridden far, when he saw a cave, near the entrance of which he
beheld a giant sitting upon a block of timber, with a knotted
iron club by his side. His goggle eyes were like flames of fire,
his countenance grim and ugly, and his cheeks like a couple of
large flitches of bacon, while the bristles of his beard resembled
rods of iron wire, and the locks that hung down upon his brawny
shoulders were like curled snakes or hissing adders. Jack
alighted from his horse, and, putting on the coat of darkness,
went up close to the giant, and said softly, "Oh! are you
there? It will not be long before I take you fast by the beard."
The giant all this while could not see him, on account of his
invisible coat, so that Jack, coming up close to the monster,
struck a blow with his sword at his head, but, missing his aim,
he cut off the nose instead. At this, the giant roared like claps
of thunder, and began to lay about him with his iron club like
one stark mad. But Jack, running behind, drove his sword up
to the hilt in the giant's back, so that he fell down dead. This
done, Jack cut off the giant's head, and sent it, with his brother's
also, to King Arthur, by a wagoner he hired for that purpose.</p>

<p>Jack now resolved to enter the giant's cave in search of his
treasure, and, passing along through a great many windings
and turnings, he came at length to a large room paved with
freestone, at the upper end of which was a boiling caldron, and
on the right hand a large table, at which the giant used to dine.
Then he came to a window, barred with iron, through which
he looked and beheld a vast number of miserable captives,
who, seeing him, cried out: "Alas! young man, art thou
come to be one amongst us in this miserable den?"</p>

<p>"Ay," quoth Jack, "but pray tell me what is the meaning
of your captivity?"</p>

<p>"We are kept here," said one, "till such time as the giants
have a wish to feast, and then the fattest among us is slaughtered!
And many are the times they have dined upon murdered
men!"</p>

<p>"Say you so," quoth Jack, and straightway unlocked the
gate and let them free, who all rejoiced like condemned men at
<span class="left"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>[page&nbsp;364]</span>
sight of a pardon. Then searching the giant's coffers, he shared
the gold and silver equally amongst them and took them to a
neighboring castle, where they all feasted and made merry over
their deliverance.</p>

<p>But in the midst of all this mirth a messenger brought news
that Thunderdell, a giant with two heads, having heard of the
death of his kinsman, had come from the northern dales to be
revenged on Jack, and was within a mile of the castle, the
country people flying before him like chaff. But Jack was not a
bit daunted, and said, "Let him come! I have a tool to quiet
him; and you, ladies and gentlemen, walk out into the garden,
and you shall witness this giant Thunderdell's death and
destruction."</p>

<p>The castle was situated in the midst of a small island surrounded
by a moat thirty feet deep and twenty feet wide, over
which lay a drawbridge. So Jack employed men to cut through
this bridge on both sides, nearly to the middle; and then,
dressing himself in his invisible coat, he marched against the
giant with his sword of sharpness. Although the giant could
not see Jack, he smelt his approach, and cried out in these
words:</p>

<div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">
<p>"Fee, fi, fo, fum!</p>
<p>I smell the blood of an Englishman!</p>
<p>Be he alive or be he dead,</p>
<p>I'll grind his bones to make me bread!"</p>
</div> </div>

<p>"Say'st thou so," said Jack; "then thou art a monstrous
miller indeed."</p>

<p>The giant cried out again, "Art thou that villain who killed
my kinsmen? Then I will tear thee with my teeth, suck thy
blood, and grind thy bones to powder."</p>

<p>"You'll have to catch me first," quoth Jack, and throwing
off his invisible coat, so that the giant might see him, and putting
on his shoes of swiftness, he ran from the giant, who followed
like a walking castle, so that the very foundations of the earth
seemed to shake at every step. Jack led him a long dance, in
order that the gentlemen and ladies might see; and at last to
end the matter, ran lightly over the drawbridge, the giant, in
full speed, pursuing him with his club. Then, coming to the
middle of the bridge, the giant's great weight broke it down,
<span class="left"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>[page&nbsp;365]</span>
and he tumbled headlong into the water, where he rolled and
wallowed like a whale. Jack, standing by the moat, laughed
at him all the while; but though the giant foamed to hear him
scoff, and plunged from place to place in the moat, yet he could
not get out to be revenged. Jack at length got a cart rope and
cast it over the two heads of the giant and drew him ashore by
a team of horses, and then cut off both his heads with his
sword of sharpness, and sent them to King Arthur.</p>

<p>After some time spent in mirth and pastime, Jack, taking
leave of the knights and ladies, set out for new adventures.
Through many woods he passed, and came at length to the
foot of a high mountain. Here, late at night, he found a lonesome
house, and knocked at the door, which was opened by
an aged man with a head as white as snow. "Father," said
Jack, "can you lodge a benighted traveler that has lost his
way?" "Yes," said the old man; "you are right welcome to
my poor cottage." Whereupon Jack entered, and down they
sat together, and the old man began to speak as follows: "Son,
I see by your belt you are the great conqueror of giants, and
behold, my son, on the top of this mountain is an enchanted
castle; this is kept by a giant named Galligantua, and he, by
the help of an old conjurer, betrays many knights and ladies
into his castle, where by magic art they are transformed into
sundry shapes and forms. But above all, I grieve for a duke's
daughter, whom they fetched from her father's garden, carrying
her through the air in a burning chariot drawn by fiery
dragons. When they secured her within the castle, they transformed
her into a white hind. And though many knights
have tried to break the enchantment, and work her deliverance,
yet no one could accomplish it, on account of two dreadful
griffins which are placed at the castle gate and which destroy
every one who comes near. But you, my son, may pass by
them undiscovered, then on the gates of the castle you will
find engraven in large letters how the spell may be broken."
Jack gave the old man his hand, and promised that in the morning
he would venture his life to free the lady.</p>

<p>In the morning Jack arose and put on his invisible coat
and magic cap and shoes, and prepared himself for the fray.
<span class="left"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>[page&nbsp;366]</span>
Now, when he had reached the top of the mountain he soon
discovered the two fiery griffins, but passed them without fear,
because of his invisible coat. When he had got beyond them,
he found upon the gates of the castle a golden trumpet hung
by a silver chain, under which these lines were engraved:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Whoever shall this trumpet blow,</p>
<p>Shall soon the giant overthrow,</p>
<p>And break the black enchantment straight;</p>
<p>So all shall be in happy state."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Jack had no sooner read this but he blew the trumpet, at
which the castle trembled to its vast foundations, and the
giant and conjurer were in horrid confusion, biting their thumbs
and tearing their hair, knowing their wicked reign was at an
end. Then the giant stooping to take up his club, Jack at
one blow cut off his head; whereupon the conjurer, mounting
up into the air, was carried away in a whirlwind. Then the
enchantment was broken, and all the lords and ladies who had
so long been transformed into birds and beasts returned to
their proper shapes, and the castle vanished away in a cloud of
smoke. This being done, the head of Galligantua was likewise,
in the usual manner, conveyed to the Court of King Arthur,
where, the very next day, Jack followed, with the knights and
ladies who had been delivered. Whereupon, as a reward for
his good services, the King prevailed upon the duke to bestow
his daughter in marriage on honest Jack. So married they
were, and the whole kingdom was filled with joy at the wedding.
Furthermore, the King bestowed on Jack a noble castle, with a
very beautiful estate thereto belonging, where he and his lady
lived in great joy and happiness all the rest of their days.</p>

<h2>THE THREE SILLIES</h2>

<h4>ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> upon a time there was a farmer and his wife who had
one daughter, and she was courted by a gentleman. Every
evening he used to come and see her, and stop to supper at the
<span class="left"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>[page&nbsp;367]</span>
farmhouse, and the daughter used to be sent down into the cellar
to draw the beer for supper. So one evening she had gone down
to draw the beer, and she happened to look up at the ceiling
while she was drawing, and she saw a mallet stuck in one of the
beams. It must have been there a long, long time, but somehow
or other she had never noticed it before, and she began a-thinking.
And she thought it was very dangerous to have that mallet
there, for she said to herself: "Suppose him and me was to be
married, and we was to have a son, and he was to grow up to be
a man, and come down into the cellar to draw the beer, like as
I'm doing now, and the mallet was to fall on his head and kill
him, what a dreadful thing it would be!" And she put down the
candle and the jug, and sat herself down and began a-crying.</p>

<p>Well, they began to wonder upstairs how it was that she was
so long drawing the beer, and her mother went down to see after
her, and she found her sitting on the settle crying, and the beer
running over the floor. "Why, whatever is the matter?" said
her mother. "Oh, mother!" says she, "look at that horrid
mallet! Suppose we was to be married, and was to have a son,
and he was to grow up, and was to come down to the cellar to
draw the beer, and the mallet was to fall on his head and kill
him, what a dreadful thing it would be!" "Dear, dear! what
a dreadful thing it would be!" said the mother, and she sat her
down beside the daughter and started crying too. Then after
a bit the father began to wonder that they didn't come back, and
he went down into the cellar to look after them himself, and
there they two sat crying, and the beer running all over the floor.
"Whatever is the matter?" says he. "Why," says the mother,
"look at that horrid mallet. Just suppose, if our daughter and
her sweetheart was to be married, and was to have a son, and he
was to grow up, and was to come down into the cellar to draw
the beer, and the mallet was to fall on his head and kill him,
what a dreadful thing it would be!" "Dear, dear, dear! so it
would!" said the father, and he sat himself down aside of the
other two, and started a-crying.</p>

<p>Now the gentleman got tired of stopping up in the kitchen
by himself, and at last he went down into the cellar too, to see
what they were after; and there they three sat crying side by side,
<span class="left"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>[page&nbsp;368]</span>
and the beer running all over the floor. And he ran straight and
turned the tap. Then he said: "Whatever are you three doing,
sitting there crying, and letting the beer run all over the floor?"
"Oh!" says the father, "look at that horrid mallet! Suppose
you and our daughter was to be married, and was to have a son,
and he was to grow up, and was to come down into the cellar to
draw the beer, and the mallet was to fall on his head and kill
him!" And then they all started crying worse than before.
But the gentleman burst out laughing, and reached up and pulled
out the mallet, and then he said: "I've traveled many miles, and
I never met three such big sillies as you three before; and now I
shall start out on my travels again, and when I can find three
bigger sillies than you three, then I'll come back and marry your
daughter." So he wished them good-by, and started off on his
travels, and left them all crying because the girl had lost her
sweetheart.</p>

<p>Well, he set out, and he traveled a long way, and at last he
came to a woman's cottage that had some grass growing on the
roof. And the woman was trying to get her cow to go up a ladder
to the grass, and the poor thing durst not go. So the gentleman
asked the woman what she was doing. "Why, lookye," she
said, "look at all that beautiful grass. I'm going to get the cow
on to the roof to eat it. She'll be quite safe, for I shall tie a
string round her neck, and pass it down the chimney, and tie it
to my wrist as I go about the house, so she can't fall off without
my knowing it." "Oh, you poor silly!" said the gentleman,
"you should cut the grass and throw it down to the cow!" But
the woman thought it was easier to get the cow up the ladder
than to get the grass down, so she pushed her and coaxed her and
got her up, and tied a string round her neck, and passed it down
the chimney, and fastened it to her own wrist. And the gentleman
went on his way, but he hadn't gone far when the cow
tumbled off the roof, and hung by the string tied round her neck,
and it strangled her. And the weight of the cow tied to her
wrist pulled the woman up the chimney, and she stuck fast halfway
and was smothered in the soot.</p>

<p>Well, that was one big silly.</p>

<p>And the gentleman went on and on, and he went to an inn to
<span class="left"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>[page&nbsp;369]</span>
stop the night, and they were so full at the inn that they had to
put him in a double-bedded room, and another traveler was to
sleep in the other bed. The other man was a very pleasant fellow,
and they got very friendly together; but in the morning,
when they were both getting up, the gentleman was surprised to
see the other hang his trousers on the knobs of the chest of
drawers and run across the room and try to jump into them, and
he tried over and over again, and couldn't manage it; and the
gentleman wondered whatever he was doing it for. At last he
stopped and wiped his face with his handkerchief. "Oh dear,"
he says, "I do think trousers are the most awkwardest kind of
clothes that ever were. I can't think who could have invented
such things. It takes me the best part of an hour to get into
mine every morning, and I get so hot! How do you manage
yours?" So the gentleman burst out laughing, and showed him
how to put them on; and he was very much obliged to him, and
said he never should have thought of doing it that way.</p>

<p>So that was another big silly.</p>

<p>Then the gentleman went on his travels again; and he came
to a village, and outside the village there was a pond, and round
the pond was a crowd of people. And they had rakes, and
brooms, and pitchforks, reaching into the pond; and the gentleman
asked what was the matter. "Why," they say, "matter
enough! Moon's tumbled into the pond, and we can't rake her
out anyhow!" So the gentleman burst out laughing, and told
them to look up into the sky, and that it was only the shadow in
the water. But they wouldn't listen to him, and abused him
shamefully and he got away as quick as he could.</p>

<p>So there were a whole lot of sillies bigger than the three sillies
at home. So the gentleman turned back home again and married
the farmer's daughter, and if they didn't live happy for ever
after, that's nothing to do with you or me.</p>

<h2>KING O'TOOLE AND HIS GOOSE</h2>

<h4>ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>CH</b>, I thought all the world, far and near, had heerd of
King O'Toole&mdash;well, well, but the darkness of mankind is
untellable! Well, sir, you must know, as you didn't hear it
afore, that there was a King, called King O'Toole, who was a
fine old King in the old ancient times, long ago; and it was he
that owned the churches in the early days. The King, you see
was the right sort; he was the real boy, and loved sport as he
loved his life, and hunting in particular; and from the rising o'
the sun, up he got, and away he went over the mountains after
the deer; and fine times they were.</p>

<p>Well, it was all mighty good, as long as the King had his
health; but, you see, in the course of time the King grew old, by
raison he was stiff in his limbs, and when he got stricken in years,
his heart failed him, and he was lost entirely for want o' diversion,
because he couldn't go a-hunting no longer; and, by dad the
poor King was obliged at last to get a goose to divert him. Oh,
you may laugh, if you like, but it's truth I'm telling you; and
the way the goose diverted him was this-a-way: You see, the
goose used to swim across the lake, and go diving for trout, and
catch fish on a Friday for the King, and flew every other day
round about the lake, diverting the poor King. All went on
mighty well until, by dad, the goose got stricken in years like
her master, and couldn't divert him no longer, and then it was
that the poor King was lost entirely. The King was walkin' one
mornin' by the edge of the lake, lamentin' his cruel fate, and
thinking of drowning himself, that could get no diversion in
life, when all of a sudden, turning round the corner, whom
<span class="left"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>[page&nbsp;371]</span>
should he meet but a mighty decent young man coming up to
him.</p>

<p>"God save you," says the King to the young man.</p>

<p>"God save you kindly, King O'Toole," says the young man.</p>

<p>"True for you," says the King. "I am King O'Toole,"
says he, "prince and plennypennytinchery of these parts," says
he; "but how came ye to know that?" says he.</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind," says Saint Kavin.</p>

<p>You see it was Saint Kavin, sure enough&mdash;the saint himself
in disguise, and nobody else. "Oh, never mind," says he, "I
know more than that. May I make bold to ask how is your
goose, King O'Toole?" says he.</p>

<p>"Blur-an-agers, how came ye to know about my goose?"
says the King.</p>

<p>"Oh, no matter; I was given to understand it," says Saint
Kavin.</p>

<p>After some more talk the King says, "What are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm an honest man," says Saint Kavin.</p>

<p>"Well, honest man," says the King, "and how is it you make
your money so aisy?"</p>

<p>"By makin' old things as good as new," says Saint Kavin.</p>

<p>"Is it a tinker you are?" says the King.</p>

<p>"No," says the saint; "I'm no tinker by trade, King O'Toole;
I've a better trade than a tinker," says he&mdash;"what would
you say," says he, "If I made your old goose as good as new?"</p>

<p>My dear, at the word of making his goose as good as new,
you'd think the poor old King's eyes were ready to jump out of
his head. With that the King whistled, and down came the poor
goose, just like a hound, waddling up to the poor cripple, her
master, and as like him as two peas. The minute the saint
clapt his eyes on the goose, "I'll do the job for you," says he,
"King O'Toole."</p>

<p>"By <i>Jaminee</i>!" says King O'Toole, "if you do, I'll say
you're the cleverest fellow in the seven parishes."</p>

<p>"Oh, by dad," says St. Kavin, "you must say more nor
that&mdash;my horn's not so soft all out," says he, "as to repair your
old goose for nothing; what'll you gi' me if I do the job for you?&mdash;that's
the chat," says Saint Kavin.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>[page&nbsp;372]</span>

<p>"I'll give you whatever you ask," says the King; "isn't that
fair?"</p>

<p>"Divil a fairer," says the saint, "that's the way to do business.
Now," says he, "this is the bargain I'll make with you, King
O'Toole: will you gi' me all the ground the goose flies over, the
first offer, after I make her as good as new?"</p>

<p>"I will," says the King.</p>

<p>"You won't go back o' your word?" says Saint Kavin.</p>

<p>"Honor bright!" says King O'Toole, holding out his
fist.</p>

<p>"Honor bright!" says Saint Kavin, back again, "it's a bargain.
Come here!" says he to the poor old goose&mdash;"come here,
you unfortunate ould cripple, and it's I that'll make you the
sporting bird." With that, my dear, he took up the goose by the
two wings&mdash;"Criss o' my cross an you," says he, markin' her to
grace with the blessed sign at the same minute&mdash;and throwing
her up in the air, "whew," says he, jist givin' her a blast to help
her; and with that, my jewel, she took to her heels, flyin' like
one o' the eagles themselves, and cutting as many capers as a
swallow before a shower of rain.</p>

<p>Well, my dear, it was a beautiful sight to see the King standing
with his mouth open, looking at his poor old goose flying as
light as a lark, and better than ever she was; and when she lit at
his feet, patted her on the head, and "<i>Mavourneen</i>," says he,
"but you are the <i>darlint</i> o' the world."</p>

<p>"And what do you say to me," says Saint Kavin, "for making
her the like?"</p>

<p>"By Jabers," says the King, "I say nothing beats the art o'
man, barring the bees."</p>

<p>"And do you say no more nor that?" says Saint Kavin.</p>

<p>"And that I'm beholden to you," says the King.</p>

<p>"But will you gi' me all the ground the goose flew over?"
says Saint Kavin.</p>

<p>"I will," says King O'Toole, "and you're welcome to it,"
says he, "though it's the last acre I have to give."</p>

<p>"But you'll keep your word true," says the saint.</p>

<p>"As true as the sun," says the King.</p>

<p>"It's well for you, King O'Toole, that you said that word,"
<span class="left"><a name="page373" id="page373"></a>[page&nbsp;373]</span>
says he; "for if you didn't say that word, the divil the bit o' your
goose would ever fly agin."</p>

<p>When the King was as good as his word, Saint Kavin was
pleased with him, and then it was that he made himself known
to the King. "And," says he, "King O'Toole, you're a dacent
man, for I only came here to try you. You don't know me,"
says he, "because I'm disguised."</p>

<p>"Musha! then," says the King, "who are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm Saint Kavin," said the saint, blessing himself.</p>

<p>"Oh, queen of heaven!" says the King, making the sign of
the cross between his eyes, and falling down on his knees before
the saint; "is it the great Saint Kavin," says he, "that I've been
discoursing all this time without knowing it," says he, "all as one
as if he was a lump of a <i>gossoon</i>?&mdash;and so you're a saint?" says
the King.</p>

<p>"I am," says Saint Kavin.</p>

<p>"By Jabers, I thought I was only talking to a dacent boy,"
says the King.</p>

<p>"Well, you know the difference now," says the saint. "I'm
Saint Kavin," says he, "the greatest of all the saints."</p>

<p>And so the King had his goose as good as new, to divert him
as long as he lived; and the saint supported him after he came
into his property, as I told you, until the day of his death&mdash;and
that was soon after; for the poor goose thought he was catching a
trout one Friday; but, my jewel, it was a mistake he made&mdash;and
instead of a trout, it was a thieving horse-eel; and instead of the
goose killing a trout for the King's supper&mdash;by dad, the eel killed
the King's goose&mdash;and small blame to him; but he didn't ate her,
because he darn't ate what Saint Kavin had laid his blessed
hands on.</p>

<h2>THE HAUGHTY PRINCESS</h2>

<h4>ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HERE</b> was once a very worthy King, whose daughter was the
greatest beauty that could be seen far or near, but she was as
proud as Lucifer, and no king or prince would she agree to marry.
<span class="left"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>[page&nbsp;374]</span>
Her father was tired out at last, and invited every king, and
prince, and duke, and earl that he knew or didn't know to come
to his court to give her one trial more. They all came, and next
day after breakfast they stood in a row in the lawn, and the Princess
walked along in the front of them to make her choice. One
was fat, and says she: "I won't have you, Beer-barrel!" One
was tall and thin, and to him she said, "I won't have you, Ramrod!"
To a white-faced man she said, "I won't have you, Pale
Death;" and to a red-cheeked man she said, "I won't have you,
Cockscomb!" She stopped a little before the last of all, for he
was a fine man in face and form. She wanted to find some defect
in him, but he had nothing remarkable but a ring of brown
curling hair under his chin. She admired him a little, and then
carried it off with, "I won't have you, Whiskers!"</p>

<p>So all went away, and the King was so vexed, he said to her,
"Now to punish your <i>impedence</i>, I'll give you to the first beggar-man
or singing <i>sthronshuch</i> that calls;" and, as sure as the
hearth-money, a fellow all over rags, with hair that came to his
shoulders, and a bushy red beard all over his face, came next
morning, and began to sing before the parlor window.</p>

<p>When the song was over, the hall-door was opened, the singer
asked in, the priest brought, and the Princess married to Beardy.
She roared and she bawled, but her father didn't mind her.
"There," says he to the bridegroom, "is five guineas for you.
Take your wife out of my sight, and never let me lay eyes on you
or her again."</p>

<p>Off he led her, and dismal enough she was. The only thing
that gave her relief was the tones of her husband's voice and his
genteel manners. "Whose wood is this?" said she, as they
were going through one. "It belongs to the King you called
Whiskers yesterday." He gave her the same answer about
meadows and cornfields, and at last a fine city. "Ah, what a
fool I was!" said she to herself. "He was a fine man, and I
might have him for a husband." At last they were coming up
to a poor cabin. "Why are you bringing me here?" says the
poor lady. "This was my house," said he, "and now it's
yours." She began to cry, but she was tired and hungry, and
she went in with him.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page375" id="page375"></a>[page&nbsp;375]</span>

<p>Ovoch! there was neither a table laid out, nor a fire burning,
and she was obliged to help her husband to light it, and boil
their dinner, and clean up the place after; and next day he made
her put on a stuff gown and a cotton handkerchief. When she
had her house readied up, and no business to keep her employed,
he brought home sallies [willows], peeled them, and showed her
how to make baskets. But the hard twigs bruised her delicate
fingers, and she began to cry. Well, then he asked her to mend
their clothes, but the needle drew blood from her fingers, and she
cried again. He couldn't bear to see her tears, so he bought a
creel of earthenware, and sent her to the market to sell them.
This was the hardest trial of all, but she looked so handsome
and sorrowful, and had such a nice air about her, that all her
pans, and jugs, and plates, and dishes were gone before noon,
and the only mark of her old pride she showed was a slap she
gave a buckeen across the face when he axed her an impudent
question.</p>

<p>Well, her husband was so glad, he sent her with another
creel the next day; but, faith! her luck was after deserting her.
A drunken huntsman came up riding, and his beast got in among
her ware, and made <i>brishe</i> of every mother's son of 'em. She
went home cryin', and her husband wasn't at all pleased. "I
see," said he, "you're not fit for business. Come along, I'll
get you a kitchen-maid's place in the palace. I know the cook."</p>

<p>So the poor thing was obliged to stifle her pride once more.
She was kept very busy, and the footman and the butler would be
very impudent about looking for a kiss, but she let a screech out
of her the first attempt was made, and the cook gave the fellow
such a lambasting with the besom that he made no second offer.
She went home to her husband every night, and she carried
broken victuals wrapped in papers in her side pockets.</p>

<p>A week after she got service there was great bustle in the
kitchen. The King was going to be married, but no one knew
who the bride was to be. Well, in the evening the cook filled the
Princess's pockets with cold meat and puddens, and, says she,
"Before you go, let us have a look at the great doings in the big
parlor." So they came near the door to get a peep, and who
should come out but the King himself, as handsome as you please,
<span class="left"><a name="page376" id="page376"></a>[page&nbsp;376]</span>
and no other but King Whiskers himself. "Your handsome
helper must pay for her peeping," said he to the cook, "and
dance a jig with me." Whether she would or no, he held her
hand and brought her into the parlor. The fiddlers struck up,
and away went <i>him</i> with <i>her</i>. But they hadn't danced two steps
when the meat and the puddens flew out of her pockets. Every
one roared out, and she flew to the door, crying piteously. But
she was soon caught by the King, and taken into the back parlor.
"Don't you know me, my darling?" said he. "I'm both King
Whiskers, your husband the ballad-singer, and the drunken
huntsman. Your father knew me well enough when he gave
you to me, and all was to drive your pride out of you." Well,
she didn't know how she was, with fright, and shame, and joy.
Love was uppermost, anyhow, for she laid her head on her husband's
breast and cried like a child. The maids-of-honor soon
had her away and dressed her as fine as hands and pins could do
it; and there were her mother and father, too. While the
company were wondering what would be the end of the handsome
girl and the King, he and his Queen, <i>who</i> they didn't
know in her fine clothes, came in, and such rejoicings and fine
doings as there was, none of us will ever see, anyway.</p>

<h2>JACK AND HIS MASTER</h2>

<h4>ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">A</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>POOR</b> woman had three sons. The eldest and second eldest
were cunning, clever fellows, but they called the youngest
Jack the Fool, because they thought he was no better than a simpleton.
The eldest got tired of staying at home, and said he'd go
look for service. He stayed away a whole year, and then came
back one day, dragging one foot after the other, and a poor,
wizened face on him, and he was as cross as two sticks. When
he was rested and had got something to eat, he told them how he
had taken service with the Gray Churl of the Townland of Mischance,
and that the agreement was whoever would first say he
<span class="left"><a name="page377" id="page377"></a>[page&nbsp;377]</span>
was sorry for his bargain should get an inch wide of the skin of
his back, from shoulder to hips, taken off. If it was the master,
he should also pay double wages; if it was the servant, he should
get no wages at all. "But the thief," says he, "gave me so little
to eat, and kept me so hard at work, that flesh and blood couldn't
stand it; and when he asked me once, when I was in a passion,
if I was sorry for my bargain, I was mad enough to say I was,
and here I am disabled for life."</p>

<p>Vexed enough were the poor mother and brothers; and the
second eldest said on the spot he'd go and take service with the
Gray Churl, and punish him by all the annoyance he'd give him
till he'd make him say he was sorry for his agreement. "Oh,
won't I be glad to see the skin coming off the old villain's back!"
said he. All they could say had no effect: he started off for the
Townland of Mischance, and in a twelvemonth he was back just
as miserable and helpless as his brother.</p>

<p>All the poor mother could say didn't prevent Jack the Fool
from starting to see if he was able to regulate the Gray Churl.
He agreed with him for a year for twenty pounds, and the terms
were the same.</p>

<p>"Now, Jack," said the Gray Churl, "if you refuse to do
anything you are able to do, you must lose a month's wages."</p>

<p>"I'm satisfied," said Jack; "and if you stop me from doing a
thing after telling me to do it, you are to give me an additional
month's wages."</p>

<p>"I am satisfied," said the master.</p>

<p>"Or if you blame me for obeying your orders, you must give
me the same."</p>

<p>"I am satisfied," said the master again.</p>

<p>The first day that Jack served he was fed very poorly, and
was worked to the saddleskirts. Next day he came into the parlor
just before the dinner was served up. They were taking the
goose off the spit, but, well becomes Jack, he whipped a knife off
the dresser, and cut off one side of the breast, one leg and thigh,
and one wing, and fell to. In came the master, and began to
abuse him for his assurance. "Oh, you know, master, you're
to feed me, and wherever the goose goes won't have to be filled
again till supper. Are you sorry for our agreement?"</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>[page&nbsp;378]</span>
<p>
The master was going to cry out he was, but he bethought
himself in time. "Oh; no, not at all," said he.</p>

<p>"That's well," said Jack.</p>

<p>Next day Jack was to go clamp turf on the bog. They
weren't sorry to have him away from the kitchen at dinner time.
He didn't find his breakfast very heavy on his stomach; so he
said to the mistress, "I think, ma'am, it will be better for me to
get my dinner now, and not lose time coming home from the
bog."</p>

<p>"That's true, Jack," said she. So she brought out a good
cake, and a print of butter, and a bottle of milk, thinking he'd
take them away to the bog. But Jack kept his seat, and never
drew rein till bread, butter, and milk had gone down the red
lane.</p>

<p>"Now, mistress," said he, "I'll be earlier at my work tomorrow
if I sleep comfortably on the sheltery side of a pile of dry
peat on dry grass, and not be coming here and going back. So
you may as well give me my supper, and be done with the day's
trouble." She gave him that, thinking he'd take it to the bog;
but he fell to on the spot, and did not leave a scrap to tell tales on
him; and the mistress was a little astonished.</p>

<p>He called to speak to the master in the haggard, and said he,
"What are servants asked to do in this country after aten their
supper?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all, but to go to bed."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, sir." He went up on the stable-loft, stripped,
and lay down, and some one that saw him told the master. He
came up.</p>

<p>"Jack, you anointed scoundrel, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"To go to sleep, master. The mistress, God bless her, is
after giving me my breakfast, dinner, and supper, and yourself
told me that bed was the next thing. Do you blame me, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you rascal, I do."</p>

<p>"Hand me out one pound thirteen and fourpence, if you
please, sir."</p>

<p>"One divil and thirteen imps, you tinker! what for?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I see, you've forgot your bargain. Are you sorry for
it?"</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page379" id="page379"></a>[page&nbsp;379]</span>

<p>"Oh, ya&mdash;NO, I mean. I'll give you the money after your
nap."</p>

<p>Next morning early Jack asked how he'd be employed that
day. "You are to be holding the plow in that fallow, outside
the paddock." The master went over about nine o'clock to see
what kind of a plowman was Jack, and what did he see but
the little boy driving the bastes, and the sock and coulter of the
plow skimming along the sod, and Jack pulling ding-dong
agin' the horses.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, you contrary thief?" said the master.</p>

<p>"An' ain't I strivin' to hold this divil of a plow, as you told
me; but that ounkrawn of a boy keeps whipping on the bastes
in spite of all I say; will you speak to him?"</p>

<p>"No, but I'll speak to you. Didn't you know, you bosthoon,
that when I said 'holding the plow,' I meant reddening
[plowing up] the ground?"</p>

<p>"Faith, an' if you did, I wish you had said so. Do you
blame me for what I have done?"</p>

<p>The master caught himself in time, but he was so stomached
[disconcerted], he said nothing.</p>

<p>"Go on and redden the ground now, you knave, as other
plowmen do."</p>

<p>"An' are you sorry for our agreement?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all, not at all!"</p>

<p>Jack plowed away like a good workman all the rest of the
day.</p>

<p>In a day or two the master bade him go and mind the cows
in a field that had half of it under young corn. "Be sure, particularly,"
said he, "to keep Browney from the wheat; while
she's out of mischief there's no fear of the rest."</p>

<p>About noon he went to see how Jack was doing his duty, and
what did he find but Jack asleep with his face to the sod, Browney
grazing near a thorn-tree, one end of a long rope round her
horns, and the other end round the tree, and the rest of the
beasts all trampling and eating the green wheat. Down came
the switch on Jack.</p>

<p>"Jack, you vagabone, do you see what the cows are at?"</p>

<p>"And do you blame me, master?"</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>[page&nbsp;380]</span>

<p>"To be sure, you lazy sluggard, I do."</p>

<p>"Hand me out one pound thirteen and fourpence, master.
You said if I only kept Browney out of mischief, the rest would,
do no harm. There she is as harmless as a lamb. Are you
sorry for hiring me, master?"</p>

<p>"To be&mdash;that is, not at all. I'll give you your money when
you go to dinner. Now, understand me; don't let a cow go out
of the field nor into the wheat the rest of the day."</p>

<p>"Never fear, master!" and neither did he. But the churl
would rather than a great deal he had not hired him.</p>

<p>The next day three heifers were missing, and the master bade
Jack go in search of them.</p>

<p>"Where shall I look for them?" said Jack.</p>

<p>"Oh, every place likely and unlikely for them all to be in."</p>

<p>The churl was getting very exact in his words. When he
was coming into the yard at dinner time, what work did he find
Jack at but pulling armfuls of the thatch off the roof, and peeping
into the holes he was making.</p>

<p>"What are you doing there, you rascal?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I'm looking for the heifers, poor things!"</p>

<p>"What would bring them there?"</p>

<p>"I don't think anything could bring them in it; but I looked
first into the likely places, that is the cowhouses, and the pastures,
and the fields next 'em, and now I'm looking in the unlikeliest
place I can think of. Maybe it's not pleasing to you
it is."</p>

<p>"And to be sure it isn't pleasing to me, you aggravating
goose-cap!"</p>

<p>"Please, sir, hand me one pound thirteen and fourpence before
you sit down to your dinner. I'm afraid it's sorrow that's
on you for hiring me at all."</p>

<p>"May the div&mdash;oh, no; I'm not sorry. Will you begin, if you
please, and put in the thatch again, just as if you were doing it
for your mother's cabin?"</p>

<p>"Oh, faith I will, sir, with a heart and a half;" and by the
time the farmer came out from his dinner, Jack had the roof
better than it was before, for he made the boy give him new
straw.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>[page&nbsp;381]</span>

<p>Says the master when he came out: "Go, Jack, and look for
the heifers, and bring them home."</p>

<p>"And where shall I look for 'em?"</p>

<p>"Go and search for them as if they were your own." The
heifers were all in the paddock before sunset.</p>

<p>Next morning says the master: "Jack, the path across the
bog to the pasture is very bad; the sheep does be sinking in it
every step; go and make the sheep's feet a good path." About
an hour after he came to the edge of the bog, and what did he
find Jack at but sharpening a carving knife, and the sheep standing
or grazing around.</p>

<p>"Is this the way you are mending the path, Jack?" said he.</p>

<p>"Everything must have a beginning, master," said Jack,
"and a thing well begun is half done. I am sharpening the
knife, and I'll have the feet off every sheep in the flock while
you'd be blessing yourself."</p>

<p>"Feet off my sheep, you anointed rogue! and what would
you be taking their feet off for?"</p>

<p>"An', sure, to mend the path as you told me. Says you,
'Jack, make a path with the foot of the sheep.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, you fool, I meant make good the path for the sheep's
feet."</p>

<p>"It's a pity you didn't say so, master. Hand me out one
pound thirteen and fourpence if you don't like me to finish my
job."</p>

<p>"Divil do you good with your one pound thirteen and four-pence!"</p>

<p>"It's better pray than curse, master. Maybe you're sorry
for your bargain?"</p>

<p>"And to be sure I am&mdash;not yet, anyway."</p>

<p>The next night the master was going to a wedding; and says
he to Jack, before he set out: "I'll leave at midnight, and I
wish you to come and be with me home, for fear I might be overtaken
with the drink. If you're there before, you may throw a
sheep's eye at me, and I'll be sure to see that they'll give you
something for yourself."</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock, while the master was in great spirits,
he felt something clammy hit him on the cheek. It fell beside
<span class="left"><a name="page382" id="page382"></a>[page&nbsp;382]</span>
his tumbler, and when he looked at it, what was it but the eye of a
sheep. Well, he couldn't imagine who threw it at him, or why
it was thrown at him. After a little he got a blow on the other
cheek, and still it was by another sheep's eye. Well, he was
much vexed, but he thought better to say nothing. In two
minutes more, when he was opening his mouth to take a sup,
another sheep's eye was slapped into it. He sputtered it out,
and cried, "Man o' the house, isn't it a great shame for you to
have any one in the room that would do such a nasty thing?"</p>

<p>"Master," says Jack, "don't blame the honest man. Sure
it's only myself that was throwin' them sheep's eyes at you, to
remind you I was here, and that I wanted to drink the bride and
bridegroom's health. You know yourself bade me."</p>

<p>"I know that you are a great rascal; and where did you get
the eyes?"</p>

<p>"An' where would I get 'em but in the heads of your own
sheep? Would you have me meddle with the bastes of any
neighbor, who might put me in the Stone Jug for it?"</p>

<p>"Sorrow on me that ever I had the bad luck to meet with you."</p>

<p>"You're all witness," said Jack, "that my master says he is
sorry for having met with me. My time is up. Master, hand
me over double wages, and come into the next room, and lay
yourself out like a man that has some decency in him, till I take
a strip of skin an inch broad from your shoulder to your hip."</p>

<p>Every one shouted out against that; but, says Jack, "You
didn't hinder him when he took the same strips from the backs
of my two brothers, and sent them home in that state, and penniless,
to their poor mother."</p>

<p>When the company heard the rights of the business, they
were only too eager to see the job done. The master bawled
and roared, but there was no help at hand. He was stripped to
his hips, and laid on the floor in the next room, and Jack had the
carving-knife in his hand ready to begin.</p>

<p>"Now you cruel old villain," said he, giving the knife a
couple of scrapes along the floor: "I'll make you an offer.
Give me, along with my double wages, two hundred guineas to
support my poor brothers, and I'll do without the strip."</p>

<p>"No!" said he, "I'd let you skin me from head to foot first."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page383" id="page383"></a>[page&nbsp;383]</span>

<p>"Here goes, then," said Jack with a grin; but the first little
scar he gave, Churl roared out, "Stop your hand; I'll give the
money."</p>

<p>"Now, neighbors," said Jack, "you mustn't think worse of
me than I deserve. I wouldn't have the heart to take an eye
out of a rat itself; I got half a dozen of them from the butcher,
and only used three of them."</p>

<p>So all came again into the other room, and Jack was made
to sit down, and everybody drank his health, and he drank
everybody's health at one offer. And six stout fellows saw himself
and the master home, and waited in the parlor while he
went up and brought down the two hundred guineas, and double
wages for Jack himself. When he got home, he brought the
summer along with him to the poor mother and the disabled
brothers; and he was no more Jack the Fool in the people's
mouths, but "Skin-Churl Jack."</p>

<h2>HUDDEN AND DUDDEN AND DONALD O'NEARY</h2>

<h4>ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HERE</b> was once upon a time two farmers, and their names
were Hudden and Dudden. They had poultry in their yards,
sheep on the uplands, and scores of cattle in the meadow land
alongside the river. But for all that they weren't happy, for
just between their two farms there lived a poor man by the name
of Donald O'Neary. He had a hovel over his head and a strip
of grass that was barely enough to keep his one cow, Daisy, from
starving, and, though she did her best, it was but seldom that
Donald got a drink of milk or a roll of butter from Daisy. You
would think there was little here to make Hudden and Dudden
jealous, but so it is, the more one has the more one wants, and
Donald's neighbors lay awake of nights scheming how they
might get hold of his little strip of grass land.</p>

<p>One day Hudden met Dudden, and they were soon grumbling
<span class="left"><a name="page384" id="page384"></a>[page&nbsp;384]</span>
as usual, and all to the tune of, "If only we could get that
vagabond, Donald O'Neary, out of the country."</p>

<p>"Let's kill Daisy," said Hudden at last; "if that doesn't
make him clear out, nothing will."</p>

<p>No sooner said than agreed; and it wasn't dark before Hudden
and Dudden crept up to the little shed where lay poor Daisy,
trying her best to chew the cud, though she hadn't had as much
grass in the day as would cover your hand. And when Donald
came to see if Daisy was all snug for the night, the poor beast
had only time to lick his hand once before she died.</p>

<p>Well, Donald was a shrewd fellow, and, downhearted though
he was, began to think if he could get any good out of Daisy's
death. He thought and he thought, and the next day you
might have seen him trudging off early to the fair, Daisy's hide
over his shoulder, every penny he had jingling in his pockets.
Just before he got to the fair, he made several slits in the hide,
put a penny in each slit, walked into the best inn of the town as
bold as if it belonged to him, and, hanging the hide up to a nail
in the wall, sat down.</p>

<p>"Some of your best whisky," says he to the landlord. But
the landlord didn't like his looks. "Is it fearing I won't pay
you, you are?" says Donald; "why, I have a hide here that gives
me all the money I want." And with that he hit it a whack
with his stick, and out hopped a penny. The landlord opened
his eyes, as you may fancy.</p>

<p>"What'll you take for that hide?"</p>

<p>"It's not for sale, my good man."</p>

<p>"Will you take a gold piece?"</p>

<p>"It's not for sale, I tell you. Hasn't it kept me and mine for
years?" and with that Donald hit the hide another whack, and
out jumped a second penny.</p>

<p>Well, the long and the short of it was that Donald let the
hide go, and, that very evening, who but he should walk up to
Hudden's door?</p>

<p>"Good evening, Hudden. Will you lend me your best pair
of scales?"</p>

<p>Hudden stared and Hudden scratched his head, but he lent
the scales.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page385" id="page385"></a>[page&nbsp;385]</span>

<p>When Donald was safe at home, he pulled out his pocketful
of bright gold and began to weigh each piece in the scales. But
Hudden had put a lump of butter at the bottom, and so the last
piece of gold stuck fast to the scales when he took them back to
Hudden.</p>

<p>If Hudden had stared before, he stared ten times more now,
and no sooner was Donald's back turned, than he was off as hard
as he could pelt to Dudden's.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Dudden. That vagabond, bad luck to
him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean Donald O'Neary?"</p>

<p>"And who else should I mean? He's back here weighing
out sackfuls of gold."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"Here are my scales that he borrowed, and here's a gold
piece still sticking to them."</p>

<p>Off they went together, and they came to Donald's door.
Donald had finished making the last pile of ten gold pieces.
And he couldn't finish, because a piece had stuck to the scales.</p>

<p>In they walked without an "If you please" or "By your
leave."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I</i> never!" that was all <i>they</i> could say.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Hudden; good evening, Dudden. Ah! you
thought you had played me a fine trick, but you never did me a
better turn in all your lives. When I found poor Daisy dead, I
thought to myself: 'Well, her hide may fetch something'; and it
did. Hides are worth their weight in gold in the market just
now."</p>

<p>Hudden nudged Dudden, and Dudden winked at Hudden.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Donald O'Neary."</p>

<p>"Good evening, kind friends."</p>

<p>The next day there wasn't a cow or a calf that belonged to
Hudden or Dudden but her hide was going to the fair in Hudden's
biggest cart, drawn by Dudden's strongest pair of horses.</p>

<p>When they came to the fair, each one took a hide over his
arm, and there they were walking through the fair, bawling out
at the top of their voices, "Hides to sell! hides to sell.'"</p>

<p>Out came the tanner:</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>[page&nbsp;386]</span>

<p>"How much for your hides, my good men?"</p>

<p>"Their weight in gold."</p>

<p>"It's early in the day to come out of the tavern." That was
all the tanner said, and back he went to his yard.</p>

<p>"Hides to sell! Fine fresh hides to sell!"</p>

<p>Out came the cobbler:</p>

<p>"How much for your hides, my men?"</p>

<p>"Their weight in gold."</p>

<p>"Is it making game of me you are? Take that for your
pains," and the cobbler dealt Hudden a blow that made him
stagger.</p>

<p>Up the people came running from one end of the fair to the
other. "What's the matter? What's the matter?" cried they.</p>

<p>"Here are a couple of vagabonds selling hides at their weight
in gold," said the cobbler.</p>

<p>"Hold 'em fast; hold 'em fast!" bawled the innkeeper, who
was the last to come up, he was so fat. "I'll wager it's one of the
rogues who tricked me out of thirty gold pieces yesterday for a
wretched hide."</p>

<p>It was more kicks than halfpence that Hudden and Dudden
got before they were well on their way home again, and they
didn't run the slower because all the dogs of the town were at
their heels.</p>

<p>Well, as you may fancy, if they loved Donald little before,
they loved him less now.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, friends?" said he, as he saw them tearing
along, their hats knocked in, and their coats torn off, and
their faces black and blue. "Is it fighting you've been? or mayhap
you met the police, ill luck to them?"</p>

<p>"We'll police you, you vagabond. It's mighty smart you
thought yourself, deluding us with your lying tales."</p>

<p>"Who deluded you? Didn't you see the gold with your own
two eyes?"</p>

<p>But it was no use talking. Pay for it he must and should.
There was a meal-sack handy, and into it Hudden and Dudden
popped Donald O'Neary, tied him up tight, ran a pole through
the knot, and off they started for the Brown Lake of the Bog, each
with a pole-end on his shoulder, and Donald O'Neary between.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page387" id="page387"></a>[page&nbsp;387]</span>

<p>But the Brown Lake was far, the road was dusty, Hudden
and Dudden were sore and weary, and parched with thirst.
There was an inn by the roadside.</p>

<p>"Let's go in," said Hudden; "I'm dead beat. It's heavy he
is for the little he had to eat."</p>

<p>If Hudden was willing, so was Dudden. As for Donald,
you may be sure his leave wasn't asked, but he was dumped down
at the inn door for all the world as if he had been a sack of potatoes.</p>

<p>"Sit still, you vagabond," said Dudden; "if we don't mind
waiting, you needn't."</p>

<p>Donald held his peace, but after a while he heard the glasses
clink, and Hudden singing away at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>"I won't have her, I tell you; I won't have her!" said Donald.
But nobody heeded what he said.</p>

<p>"I won't have her, I tell you; I won't have her!" said Donald;
and this time he said it louder; but nobody heeded what
he said.</p>

<p>"I won't have her, I tell you; I won't have her!" said Donald;
and this time he said it as loud as he could.</p>

<p>"And who won't you have, may I be so bold as to ask?"
said a farmer, who had just come up with a drove of cattle, and
was turning in for a glass.</p>

<p>"It's the King's daughter. They are bothering the life out
of me to marry her."</p>

<p>"You're the lucky fellow. I'd give something to be in your
shoes."</p>

<p>"Do you see that, now! Wouldn't it be a fine thing for a
farmer to be marrying a Princess, all dressed in gold and
jewels?"</p>

<p>"Jewels, you say? Ah, now, couldn't you take me with you?"</p>

<p>"Well, you're an honest fellow, and as I don't care for the
King's daughter, though she's as beautiful as the day, and is
covered with jewels from top to toe, you shall have her. Just
undo the cord and let me out; they tied me up tight, as they
knew I'd run away from her."</p>

<p>Out crawled Donald; in crept the farmer.</p>

<p>"Now lie still, and don't mind the shaking; it's only rumbling
<span class="left"><a name="page388" id="page388"></a>[page&nbsp;388]</span>
over the palace steps you'll be. And maybe they'll abuse you
for a vagabond, who won't have the King's daughter; but you
needn't mind that. Ah, it's a deal I'm giving up for you, sure
as it is that I don't care for the Princess."</p>

<p>"Take my cattle in exchange," said the farmer; and you
may guess it wasn't long before Donald was at their tails,
driving them homeward.</p>

<p>Out came Hudden and Dudden, and the one took one end of
the pole, and the other the other.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking he's heavier," said Hudden.</p>

<p>"Ah, never mind," said Dudden; "it's only a step now to
the Brown Lake."</p>

<p>"I'll have her now! I'll have her now!" bawled the farmer
from inside the sack.</p>

<p>"By my faith and you shall, though," said Hudden, and he
laid his stick across the sack.</p>

<p>"I'll have her! I'll have her!" bawled the farmer, louder
than ever.</p>

<p>"Well, here you are," said Dudden, for they were now come
to the Brown Lake, and, unslinging the sack, they pitched it
plump into the lake.</p>

<p>"You'll not be playing your tricks on us any longer," said
Hudden.</p>

<p>"True for you," said Dudden. "Ah, Donald, my boy, it
was an ill day when you borrowed my scales!"</p>

<p>Off they went, with a light step and an easy heart, but when
they were near home, whom should they see but Donald O'Neary,
and all around him the cows were grazing, and the calves were
kicking up their heels and butting their heads together.</p>

<p>"Is it you, Donald?" said Dudden. "Faith, you've been
quicker than we have."</p>

<p>"True for you, Dudden, and let me thank you kindly; the
turn was good, if the will was ill. You'll have heard, like me,
that the Brown Lake leads to the Land of Promise. I always
put it down as lies, but it is just as true as my word. Look at
the cattle."</p>

<p>Hudden stared, and Dudden gaped; but they couldn't get
over the cattle; fine, fat cattle they were, too.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page389" id="page389"></a>[page&nbsp;389]</span>

<p>"It's only the worst I could bring up with me," said Donald
O'Neary; "the others were so fat, there was no driving them.
Faith, too, it's little wonder they didn't care to leave, with grass
as far as you could see, and as sweet and juicy as fresh butter."</p>

<p>"Ah now, Donald, we haven't always been friends," said
Dudden, "but, as I was just saying, you were ever a decent
lad, and you'll show us the way, won't you?"</p>

<p>"I don't see that I'm called upon to do that; there is a power
more cattle down there. Why shouldn't I have them all to
myself?"</p>

<p>"Faith, they may well say, the richer you get, the harder
the heart. You always were a neighborly lad, Donald. You
wouldn't wish to keep the luck all to yourself?"</p>

<p>"True for you, Hudden, though it's a bad example you set
me. But I'll not be thinking of old times. There is plenty for
all there, so come along with me."</p>

<p>Off they trudged, with a light heart and an eager step.
When they came to the Brown Lake the sky was full of little
white clouds, and, if the sky was full, the lake was as full.</p>

<p>"Ah, now, look! there they are!" cried Donald as he pointed
to the clouds in the lake.</p>

<p>"Where? where?" cried Hudden, and "Don't be greedy!"
cried Dudden, as he jumped his hardest to be up first with the
fat cattle. But if he jumped first, Hudden wasn't long behind.</p>

<p>They never came back. Maybe they got too fat, like the
cattle. As for Donald O'Neary, he had cattle and sheep all his
days to his heart's content.</p>

<h2>CONNLA OF THE GOLDEN HAIR AND THE FAIRY MAIDEN</h2>

<h4>ADAPTED BY PATRICK WESTON JOYCE</h4>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">C</span></p>
<p><b>ONNLA</b> of the Golden Hair was the son of Conn the Hundred-fighter.
One day as he stood with his father on the
royal Hill of Usna, he saw a lady a little way off, very beautiful,
<span class="left"><a name="page390" id="page390"></a>[page&nbsp;390]</span>
and dressed in strange attire. She approached the spot where he
stood; and when she was near, he spoke to her, and asked who
she was, and from what place she had come.</p>

<p>The lady replied: "I have come from the Land of the
Living&mdash;a land where there is neither death nor old age, nor
any breach of law. The inhabitants of earth call us Aes-shee,
for we have our dwellings within large, pleasant, green hills.
We pass our time very pleasantly in feasting and harmless
amusements, never growing old; and we have no quarrels or
contentions."</p>

<p>The King and his company marveled very much; for though
they heard this conversation, no one saw the lady except Connla
alone.</p>

<p>"Who is this thou art talking to, my son?" said the King.</p>

<p>And anon she answered for the youth: "Connla is speaking
with a lovely, noble-born young lady, who will never die, and
who will never grow old. I love Connla of the Golden Hair,
and I have come to bring him with me to Moy-mell, the
plain of never-ending pleasure. On the day that he comes
with me he shall be made King, and he shall reign for ever in
Fairyland, without weeping and without sorrow. Come with
me, O gentle Connla of the ruddy cheek, the fair, freckled neck,
and the golden hair! Come with me, beloved Connla, and thou
shalt retain the comeliness and dignity of thy form, free from
the wrinkles of old age, till the awful day of judgment."</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Thy flowing golden hair, thy comely face,</p>
<p>Thy all majestic form of peerless grace,</p>
<p>That show thee sprung from Conn's exalted race."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>King Conn the Hundred-fighter being much troubled,
called then on his druid Coran, to put forth his power against
the witchery of the banshee: "O Coran of the mystic arts
and of the mighty incantations, here is a contest such as I have
never been engaged in since I was made King at Tara&mdash;a contest
with an invisible lady, who is beguiling my son to Fairyland
by her baleful charms. Her cunning is beyond my skill, and
I am not able to withstand her power; and if thou, Coran, help
<span class="left"><a name="page391" id="page391"></a>[page&nbsp;391]</span>
not, my son will be taken away from me by the wiles and
witchery of a woman from the fairy hills."</p>

<p>Coran the druid then came forward, and began to chant
against the voice of the lady. And his power was greater than
hers for that time, so that she was forced to retire.</p>

<p>As she was going away she threw an apple to Connla,
who straightway lost sight of her; and the King and his people
no longer heard her voice.</p>

<p>The King and the Prince returned with their company to
the palace; and Connla remained for a whole month without
tasting food or drink except the apple. And though he ate of
it each day, it was never lessened, but was as whole and perfect
in the end as at the beginning. Moreover, when they offered
him aught else to eat or drink he refused it; for while he had
his apple he did not deem any other food worthy to be tasted.
And he began to be very moody and sorrowful, thinking of the
lovely fairy maiden.</p>

<p>At the end of the month, as Connla stood by his father's
side among the nobles, on the Plain of Arcomin, he saw the
lady approaching him from the west. And when she had
come near, she addressed him in this manner: "A glorious
seat, indeed, has Connla among wretched, short-lived mortals,
awaiting the dreadful stroke of death! But now, the ever-youthful
people of Moy-mell, who never feel age, and who fear
not death, seeing thee day by day among thy friends, in the assemblies
of thy fatherland, love thee with a strange love, and
they will make thee King over them if thou wilt come with me."</p>

<p>When the King heard the words of the lady, he commanded
his people to call the druid again to him, saying, "Bring my
druid Coran to me; for I see that the fairy lady has this day
regained the power of her voice."</p>

<p>At this the lady said: "Valiant Conn, fighter of a hundred,
the faith of the druids has come to little honor among the upright,
mighty, numberless people of this land. When the righteous
law shall be restored, it will seal up the lips of the false black
demon; and his druids shall no longer have power to work their
guileful spells."</p>

<p>Now the King observed, and marveled greatly, that whenever
<span class="left"><a name="page392" id="page392"></a>[page&nbsp;392]</span>
the lady was present his son never spoke one word to any
one, even though they addressed him many times. And when
the lady had ceased to speak, the King said: "Connla, my son,
has thy mind been moved by the words of the lady?"</p>

<p>Connla spake then, and replied, "Father, I am very unhappy;
for though I love my people beyond all, I am filled with
sadness on account of this lady!"</p>

<p>When Connla had said this, the maiden again addressed
him, and chanted these words in a very sweet voice:</p>

away over the bright sea towards the sunset. They gazed
sadly after them, till they lost sight of the canoe over the utmost

was never again seen in his native land.</p>

<h4>MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HERE</b> was once upon a time ...</p>

<p>"A king!" my little readers will instantly exclaim.</p>

<p>No, children, you are wrong. There was once upon a time
a piece of wood.</p>

<p>This wood was not valuable; it was only a common log
like those that are burnt in winter in the stoves and fireplaces
to make a cheerful blaze and warm the rooms.</p>

<p>I cannot say how it came about, but the fact is, that one
fine day this piece of wood was lying in the shop of an old
carpenter of the name of Master Antonio. He was, however,
called by everybody Master Cherry, on account of the end of
his nose, which was always as red and polished as a ripe cherry.</p>

<p>No sooner had Master Cherry set his eyes on the piece of
wood than his face beamed with delight; and, rubbing his
hands together with satisfaction, he said softly to himself:</p>

<p>"This wood has come at the right moment; it will just do to
make the leg of a little table."</p>

<p>Having said this he immediately took a sharp axe with which
to remove the bark and the rough surface. Just, however, as he
was going to give the first stroke he remained with his arm suspended
in the air, for he heard a very small voice saying imploringly:
"Do not strike me so hard!"</p>

<p>Picture to yourselves the astonishment of good old Master
Cherry!</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>[page&nbsp;395]</span>

<p>He turned his terrified eyes all around the room to try and
discover where the little voice could possibly have come from,
but he saw nobody! He looked under the bench&mdash;nobody; he
looked into a cupboard that was always shut&mdash;nobody; he looked
into a basket of shavings and sawdust&mdash;nobody; he even opened
the door of the shop and gave a glance into the street&mdash;and still
nobody. Who, then, could it be?</p>

<p>"I see how it is;" he said, laughing and scratching his wig;
"evidently that little voice was all my imagination. Let us set
to work again."</p>

<p>And taking up the axe he struck a tremendous blow on the
piece of wood.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! you have hurt me!" cried the same little voice
dolefully.</p>

<p>This time Master Cherry was petrified. His eyes started
out of his head with fright, his mouth remained open, and his
tongue hung out almost to the end of his chin like a mask on a
fountain. As soon as he had recovered the use of his speech, he
began to say, stuttering and trembling with fear:</p>

<p>"But where on earth can that little voice have come from that
said 'Oh! oh!?' ... Here there is certainly not a living soul.
Is it possible that this piece of wood can have learnt to cry and to
lament like a child? I cannot believe it. This piece of wood
here it is; a log for fuel like all others, and thrown on the fire it
would about suffice to boil a saucepan of beans.... How then?
Can anyone be hidden inside it? If anyone is hidden inside, so
much the worse for him. I will settle him at once."</p>

<p>So saying he seized the poor piece of wood and commenced
beating it without mercy against the walls of the room.</p>

<p>Then he stopped to listen if he could hear any little voice
lamenting. He waited two minutes&mdash;nothing; five minutes-nothing;
ten minutes&mdash;still nothing!</p>

<p>"I see how it is," he then said, forcing himself to laugh and
pushing up his wig; "evidently, the little voice that said 'Oh! oh!'
was all my imagination! Let us to work again."</p>

<p>But all the same he was in a great fright; he tried to sing to
give himself a little courage.</p>

<p>Putting the axe aside he took his plane to plane and polish
<span class="left"><a name="page396" id="page396"></a>[page&nbsp;396]</span>
the bit of wood; but whilst he was running it up and down he
heard the same little voice say, laughing:</p>

<p>"Have done! you are tickling me all over!"</p>

<p>This time poor Master Cherry fell down as if he had been
struck by lightning. When he at last opened his eyes he found
himself seated on the floor.</p>

<p>His face was quite changed; even the end of his nose, instead
of being crimson, as it was nearly always, had become blue from
fright.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<h4>GEPPETTO PLANS A WONDERFUL PUPPET</h4>


<p>At that moment some one knocked at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in," said the carpenter, without having the strength
to rise to his feet.</p>

<p>A lively little old man immediately walked into the shop.
His name was Geppetto, but when the boys in the neighborhood
wished to put him in a passion they called him by the nickname
of Polendina, because his yellow wig greatly resembled a pudding
made of Indian corn.</p>

<p>Geppetto was very fiery. Woe to him who called him Polendina!
He became furious, and there was no holding him.</p>

<p>"Good day, Master Antonio," said Geppetto; "what are
you doing there on the floor?"</p>

<p>"I am teaching the alphabet to the ants."</p>

<p>"Much good may that do you."</p>

<p>"What has brought you to me, neighbor Geppetto?"</p>

<p>"My legs. But to say the truth, Master Antonio, I am come
to ask a favor of you."</p>

<p>"Here I am ready to serve you," replied the carpenter getting
on his knees.</p>

<p>"This morning an idea came into my head."</p>

<p>"Let us hear it."</p>

<p>"I thought I would make a beautiful wooden puppet that
should know how to dance, to fence, and to leap like an acrobat.
With this puppet I would travel about the world to earn a piece
of bread and a glass of wine. What do you think of it?"</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>[page&nbsp;397]</span>

<p>"Bravo, Polendina!" exclaimed the same little voice, and it
was impossible to say where it came from.</p>

<p>Hearing himself called Polendina, Geppetto became as red
as a turkey-cock from rage, and turning to the carpenter he said
in a fury:</p>

<p>"Why do you insult me?"</p>

<p>"Who insults you?"</p>

<p>"You called me Polendina!"</p>

<p>"It was not I!"</p>

<p>"Would you have it then, that it was I? It was you, I say!"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>And becoming more and more angry, from words they came
to blows, and flying at each other they bit, and fought, and
scratched manfully.</p>

<p>When the fight was over Master Antonio was in possession of
Geppetto's yellow wig, and Geppetto discovered that the gray
wig belonging to the carpenter had remained between his teeth.</p>

<p>"Give me back my wig," screamed Master Antonio.</p>

<p>"And you return me mine, and let us make friends."</p>

<p>The two old men having each recovered his own wig shook
hands, and swore that they would remain friends to the end of
their lives.</p>

<p>"Well then, neighbor Geppetto," said the carpenter, to
prove that peace was made, "what is the favor that you wish
of me?"</p>

<p>"I want a little wood to make my puppet; will you give me
some?"</p>

<p>Master Antonio was delighted, and he immediately went to
the bench and fetched the piece of wood that had caused him
so much fear. Just as he was going to give it to his friend the
piece of wood gave a shake and wriggling violently out of his
hands struck with all its force against the dried-up shins of
poor Geppetto.</p>

<p>"Ah! is that the courteous way in which you make your
presents, Master Antonio? You have almost lamed me!"</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page398" id="page398"></a>[page&nbsp;398]</span>

<p>"I swear to you that it was not I!"</p>

<p>"Then you would have it that it was I?"</p>

<p>"The wood is entirely to blame!"</p>

<p>"I know that it was the wood, but it was you that hit my
legs with it!"</p>

<p>"I did not hit you with it!"</p>

<p>"Liar!"</p>

<p>"Geppetto, don't insult me or I will call you Polendina!"</p>

<p>"Ass!"</p>

<p>"Polendina!"</p>

<p>"Donkey!"</p>

<p>"Polendina!"</p>

<p>"Baboon!"</p>

<p>"Polendina!"</p>

<p>On hearing himself called Polendina for the third time
Geppetto, blind with rage, fell upon the carpenter and they
fought desperately.</p>

<p>When the battle was over, Master Antonio had two more
scratches on his nose, and his adversary had two buttons
less on his waistcoat. Their accounts being thus squared
they shook hands, and swore to remain good friends for the rest
of their lives.</p>

<p>Geppetto carried off his fine piece of wood, and thanking
Master Antonio returned limping to his house.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<h4>THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO</h4>


<p>Geppetto lived in a small ground-floor room that was only
lighted from the staircase. The furniture could not have been
simpler&mdash;a bad chair, a poor bed, and a broken-down table.
At the end of the room there was a fireplace with a lighted fire;
but the fire was painted, and by the fire was painted a saucepan
that was boiling cheerfully, and sending out a cloud of smoke
that looked exactly like real smoke.</p>

<p>As soon as he reached home Geppetto took his tools and set
to work to cut out and model his puppet.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page399" id="page399"></a>[page&nbsp;399]</span>

<p>"What name shall I give him?" he said to himself; "I
think I will call him Pinocchio. It is a name that will bring
him luck. I once knew a whole family so called. There was
Pinocchio the father, Pinocchia the mother, and Pinocchi
the children, and all of them did well. The richest of them was
a beggar."</p>

<p>Having found a name for his puppet he began to work in
good earnest, and he first made his hair, then his forehead and
then his eyes.</p>

<p>The eyes being finished, imagine his astonishment when he
perceived that they moved and looked fixedly at him.</p>

<p>Geppetto seeing himself stared at by those two wooden eyes,
took it almost in bad part, and said in an angry voice:</p>

<p>"Wicked wooden eyes, why do you look at me?"</p>

<p>No one answered.</p>

<p>Then he proceeded to carve the nose; but no sooner had he
made it than it began to grow. And it grew, and grew, and
grew until in a few minutes it had become an immense nose that
seemed as if it would never end.</p>

<p>Poor Geppetto tired himself out with cutting it off. But
the more he cut and shortened it, the longer did that impertinent
nose become!</p>

<p>The mouth was not even completed when it began to laugh
and deride him.</p>

<p>"Stop laughing!" said Geppetto provoked; but he might
as well have spoken to the wall.</p>

<p>"Stop laughing, I say!" he roared in a threatening tone.</p>

<p>The mouth then ceased laughing, but put out its tongue
as far as it would go.</p>

<p>Geppetto, not to spoil his handiwork, pretended not to see,
and continued his labors. After the mouth he fashioned the
chin, then the throat, and then the shoulders, the stomach,
the arms and the hands.</p>

<p>The hands were scarcely finished when Geppetto felt
his wig snatched from his head. He turned round, and
what did he see? He saw his yellow wig in the puppet's
hand.</p>

<p>"Pinocchio!... Give me back my wig instantly!"</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>[page&nbsp;400]</span>
<p>
But Pinocchio instead of returning it, put it on his own
head, and was in consequence nearly smothered.</p>

<p>Geppetto at this insolent and derisive behavior felt sadder
and more melancholy than he had ever been in his life before;
and turning to Pinocchio he said to him:</p>

<p>"You young rascal! You are not yet completed, and you
are already beginning to show want of respect to your father!
That is bad, my boy, very bad."</p>

<p>And he dried a tear.</p>

<p>The legs and feet remained to be done.</p>

<p>When Geppetto had finished the feet he received a kick on
the point of the nose.</p>

<p>"I deserve it!" he said to himself; "I should have thought
of it sooner! Now it is too late!"</p>

<p>He then took the puppet under the arms and placed him on
the floor to teach him to walk.</p>

<p>Pinocchio's legs were stiff and he could not move, but Geppetto
led him by the hand and showed him how to put one foot
before the other.</p>

<p>When his legs became flexible Pinocchio began to walk by
himself and to run about the room; until, having gone out of the
house door, he jumped into the street and escaped.</p>

<p>Poor Geppetto rushed after him but was not able to overtake
him, for that rascal Pinocchio leapt in front of him like a hare,
and knocking his wooden feet together against the pavement
made as much clatter as twenty pairs of peasant's clogs.</p>

<p>"Stop him! stop him!" shouted Geppetto; but the people in
the street, seeing a wooden puppet running like a racehorse
stood still in astonishment to look at it, and laughed, and laughed,
and laughed, until it beats description....</p>

<h4>THE FIRE-EATER FRIGHTENS PINOCCHIO</h4>


<p>When Pinocchio came into the little puppet theater, an incident
occurred that almost produced a revolution.
<span class="left"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>[page&nbsp;401]</span>
I must tell you that the curtain was drawn up, and the play
had already begun.</p>

<p>On the stage Harlequin and Punchinello were as usual
quarreling with each other, and threatening every moment to
come to blows.</p>

<p>The audience, all attention, laughed till they were ill as they
listened to the bickerings of these two puppets, who gesticulated
and abused each other so naturally that they might have been
two reasonable beings, and two persons of the world.</p>

<p>All at once Harlequin stopped short, and turning to the public
he pointed with his hand to some one far down in the pit, and
exclaimed in a dramatic tone:</p>

<p>"Gods of the firmament! do I dream, or am I awake? But
surely that is Pinocchio!"</p>

<p>"It is indeed Pinocchio!" cried Punchinello.</p>

<p>"It is indeed himself!" screamed Miss Rose, peeping from
behind the scenes.</p>

<p>"It is Pinocchio! it is Pinocchio!" shouted all the puppets in
chorus, leaping from all sides on to the stage. "It is Pinocchio!
It is our brother Pinocchio! Long live Pinocchio!"</p>

<p>"Pinocchio, come up here to me," cried Harlequin, "and
throw yourself into the arms of your wooden brothers!"</p>

<p>At this affectionate invitation Pinocchio made a leap from
the end of the pit into the reserved seats; another leap landed
him on the head of the leader of the orchestra, and then he
sprang upon the stage.</p>

<p>The embraces, the hugs, the friendly pinches, and the demonstrations
of warm brotherly affection that Pinocchio received
from the excited crowd of actors and actresses of the puppet
dramatic company beat description.</p>

<p>The sight was doubtless a moving one, but the public in the
pit, finding that the play was stopped, became impatient, and
began to shout "We will have the play&mdash;go on with the play!"</p>

<p>It was all breath thrown away. The puppets, instead of
continuing the recital, redoubled their noise and outcries, and
putting Pinocchio on their shoulders they carried him in triumph
before the footlights.</p>

<p>At that moment out came the showman. He was very big
<span class="left"><a name="page402" id="page402"></a>[page&nbsp;402]</span>
and so ugly that the sight of him was enough to frighten anyone.
His beard was as black as ink, and so long that it reached from
his chin to the ground. I need only say that he trod upon it
when he walked. His mouth was as big as an oven, and his
eyes were like two lanterns of red glass with lights burning inside
of them. He carried a whip made of snakes and foxes' tails
twisted together, which he cracked constantly.</p>

<p>At his unexpected appearance there was a profound silence:
no one dared to breathe. A fly might have been heard in the
stillness. The poor puppets of both sexes trembled like so many
leaves.</p>

<p>"Why have you come to raise a disturbance in my theater?"
asked the showman of Pinocchio in the gruff voice of a hob-goblin
suffering from a severe cold in the head.</p>

<p>"Believe me, honored sir, that it was not my fault!"</p>

<p>"That is enough! To-night we will settle our accounts."</p>

<p>As soon as the play was over the showman went into the
kitchen where a fine sheep, preparing for his supper, was turning
slowly on the spit in front of the fire. As there was not enough
wood to finish roasting and browning it, he called Harlequin and
Punchinello, and said to them:</p>

<p>"Bring that puppet here; you will find him hanging on a nail.
It seems to me that he is made of very dry wood, and I am sure
that if he was thrown on the fire he would make a beautiful
blaze for the roast."</p>

<p>At first Harlequin and Punchinello hesitated; but, appalled
by a severe glance from their master, they obeyed. In a short
time they returned to the kitchen carrying poor Pinocchio, who
was wriggling like an eel taken out of water, and screaming desperately,
"Papa! papa! save me! I will not die, I will not
die!"</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<h4>FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO</h4>


<p>The showman Fire-eater&mdash;for that was his name&mdash;looked, I
must say, a terrible man, especially with his black beard that
covered his chest and legs like an apron. On the whole, however,
<span class="left"><a name="page403" id="page403"></a>[page&nbsp;403]</span>
he had not a bad heart. In proof of this, when he saw
Pinocchio brought before him, struggling and screaming "I will
not die, I will not die!" he was quite moved and felt sorry for
him. He tried to hold out, but after a little he could stand it no
longer and he sneezed violently. When he heard the sneeze,
Harlequin, who up to that moment had been in the deepest affliction,
and bowed down like a weeping willow, became quite
cheerful, and leaning towards Pinocchio he whispered to him
softly:</p>

<p>"Good news, brother. The showman has sneezed, and
that is a sign that he pities you, and consequently you are
saved."</p>

<p>For you must know that whilst most men when they feel
compassion for somebody either weep, or at least pretend to
dry their eyes, Fire-eater, on the contrary, had the habit of
sneezing.</p>

<p>After he had sneezed, the showman, still acting the ruffian,
shouted to Pinocchio:</p>

<p>"Have done crying! Your lamentations have given me a
pain in my stomach ... I feel a spasm, that almost ...
Etci! etci!" and he sneezed again twice.</p>

<p>"Bless you!" said Pinocchio.</p>

<p>"Thank you! And your papa and your mamma, are they
still alive?" asked Fire-eater.</p>

<p>"Papa, yes: my mamma I have never known."</p>

<p>"Who can say what a sorrow it would be to your poor old
father if I was to have you thrown amongst those burning
coals! Poor old man! I compassionate him!... Etci!
etci! etci!" and he sneezed three times.</p>

<p>"Bless you!" said Pinocchio.</p>

<p>"Thank you! All the same, some compassion is due to
me, for you see I have no more wood with which to finish
roasting my mutton, and to tell you the truth, under the circumstances
you would have been of great use to me! However,
I have had pity on you, so I must have patience. Instead
of you I will burn under the spit one of the puppets
belonging to my company. Ho there, gendarmes!"</p>

<p>At this call two wooden gendarmes immediately appeared.
<span class="left"><a name="page404" id="page404"></a>[page&nbsp;404]</span>
They were very long and very thin and had on cocked hats,
and held unsheathed swords in their hands.</p>

<p>The showman said to them in a hoarse voice:</p>

<p>"Take Harlequin, bind him securely, and then throw him
on the fire to burn. I am determined that my mutton shall
be well roasted."</p>

<p>Only imagine that poor Harlequin! His terror was so
great that his legs bent under him, and he fell with his face on
the ground.</p>

<p>At this agonizing sight Pinocchio, weeping bitterly, threw
himself at the showman's feet, and bathing his long beard with
his tears he began to say in a supplicating voice:</p>

<p>"Have pity, Sir Fire-eater!"</p>

<p>"Here there are no sirs," the showman answered severely.</p>

<p>"Have pity, Sir Knight!"</p>

<p>"Here there are no knights!"</p>

<p>"Have pity, Commander!"</p>

<p>"Here there are no commanders!"</p>

<p>"Have pity, Excellence!"</p>

<p>Upon hearing himself called Excellence the showman
began to smile, and became at once kinder and more tractable.
Turning to Pinocchio he asked:</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want from me?"</p>

<p>"I implore you to pardon poor Harlequin."</p>

<p>"For him there can be no pardon. As I have spared you
he must be put on the fire, for I am determined that my mutton
shall be well roasted."</p>

<p>"In that case," cried Pinocchio proudly, rising and throwing
away his cap of bread crumb "in that case I know my
duty. Come on, gendarmes! Bind me and throw me amongst
the flames. No, it is not just that poor Harlequin, my true
friend, should die for me!"</p>

<p>These words, pronounced in a loud heroic voice, made all
the puppets who were present cry. Even the gendarmes,
although they were made of wood, wept like two newly-born
lambs.</p>

<p>Fire-eater at first remained as hard and unmoved as ice,
but little by little he began to melt and to sneeze. And having
<span class="left"><a name="page405" id="page405"></a>[page&nbsp;405]</span>
sneezed four or five times, he opened his arms affectionately,
and said to Pinocchio:</p>

<p>"You are a good brave boy! Come here and give me a
kiss."</p>

<p>Pinocchio ran at once, and climbing like a squirrel up the
showman's beard he deposited a hearty kiss on the point of
his nose.</p>

<p>"Then the pardon is granted?" asked poor Harlequin in
a faint voice that was scarcely audible.</p>

<p>"The pardon is granted!" answered Fire-eater. He then
added, sighing and shaking his head:</p>

<p>"I must have patience! To-night I shall have to resign
myself to eat the mutton half raw; but another time, woe to
him who chances!"</p>

<p>At the news of the pardon all the puppets ran to the stage,
and having lighted the lamps and chandeliers as if for a full-dress
performance, they began to leap and to dance merrily.
At dawn they were still dancing.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<h4>THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS</h4>


<p>The following day Fire-eater called Pinocchio to one side
and asked him:</p>

<p>"What is your father's name?"</p>

<p>"Geppetto."</p>

<p>"And what trade does he follow?"</p>

<p>"He is a beggar."</p>

<p>"Does he gain much?"</p>

<p>"Gain much? Why, he has never a penny in his pocket.
Only think, to buy a spelling-book for me to go to school, he
was obliged to sell the only coat he had to wear&mdash;a coat that
between patches and darns was not fit to be seen."</p>

<p>"Poor devil! I feel almost sorry for him! Here are five
gold pieces. Go at once and take them to him with my compliments."</p>

<p>You can easily understand that Pinocchio thanked the
<span class="left"><a name="page406" id="page406"></a>[page&nbsp;406]</span>
showman a thousand times. He embraced all the puppets
of the company one by one, even to the gendarmes, and beside
himself with delight set out to return home.</p>

<p>But he had not gone far when he met on the road a Fox
lame in one foot, and a Cat blind in both eyes, who were going
along helping each other like good companions in misfortune.
The Fox who was lame walked leaning on the Cat, and the
Cat who was blind was guided by the Fox.</p>

<p>"Good day, Pinocchio," said the Fox, accosting him politely.</p>

<p>"How do you come to know my name?" asked the puppet.</p>

<p>"I know your father well."</p>

<p>"Where did you see him?"</p>

<p>"I saw him yesterday at the door of his house."</p>

<p>"And what was he doing?"</p>

<p>"He was in his shirt sleeves and shivering with cold."</p>

<p>"Poor papa! But that is over; for the future he shall
shiver no more."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I am become a gentleman."</p>

<p>"A gentleman&mdash;you!" said the Fox, and he began to laugh
rudely and scornfully. The Cat also began to laugh, but to
conceal it she combed her whiskers with her forepaws.</p>

<p>"There is little to laugh at," cried Pinocchio angrily. "I
am really sorry to make your mouths water, but if you know
anything about it, you can see that here are five gold pieces."</p>

<p>And he pulled out the money that Fire-eater had made him
a present of.</p>

<p>At the sympathetic ring of the money the Fox with an involuntary
movement stretched out the paw that had seemed
crippled, and the cat opened wide two eyes that looked like
two green lanterns. It is true that she shut them again, and
so quickly that Pinocchio observed nothing.</p>

<p>"And now," asked the Fox, "what are you going to do
with all that money?"</p>

<p>"First of all," answered the Puppet, "I intend to buy a
new coat for my papa, made of gold and silver, and with diamond
buttons, and then I will buy a spelling-book for myself."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page407" id="page407"></a>[page&nbsp;407]</span>
<p>
"For yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, for I wish to go to school to study in earnest."</p>

<p>"Look at me!" said the Fox. "Through my foolish passion
for study I have lost a leg."</p>

<p>"Look at me!" said the Cat. "Through my foolish passion
for study I have lost the sight of both my eyes."</p>

<p>At that moment a white Blackbird, that was perched on
the hedge by the road, began his usual song, and said:</p>

<p>"Pinocchio, don't listen to the advice of bad companions;
if you do you will repent it!"</p>

<p>Poor Blackbird! If only he had not spoken! The Cat
with a great leap sprang upon him and without even giving
him time to say "Oh!" ate him in a mouthful, feathers and
all.</p>

<p>Having eaten him and cleaned her mouth she shut her eyes
again and feigned blindness as before.</p>

<p>"Poor Blackbird!" said Pinocchio to the Cat. "Why did
you treat him so badly?"</p>

<p>"I did it to give him a lesson. He will learn another time
not to meddle in other people's conversation."</p>

<p>They had gone almost half-way when the Fox, halting
suddenly, said to the puppet:</p>

<p>"Would you like to double your money?"</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"Would you like to make out of your five miserable gold
pieces, a hundred, a thousand, two thousand?"</p>

<p>"I should think so! But in what way?"</p>

<p>"The way is easy enough. Instead of returning home you
must go with us."</p>

<p>"And where do you wish to take me?"</p>

<p>"To the Land of the Owls."</p>

<p>Pinocchio reflected a moment, and then he said resolutely:</p>

<p>"No, I will not go. I am already close to the house, and I
will return home to my papa who is waiting for me. Who can
tell how often the poor old man must have sighed yesterday
when I did not come back! I have been a bad son, indeed,
and the Talking-cricket was right when he said 'Disobedient
boys never come to any good in the world.' I have found it
<span class="left"><a name="page408" id="page408"></a>[page&nbsp;408]</span>
to my cost, for many misfortunes have happened to me. Even
yesterday in Fire-eater's house I ran the risk.... Oh!
it makes me shudder only to think of it."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said the Fox, "you are quite decided to go
home? Go, then, and so much the worse for you."</p>

<p>"So much the worse for you!" repeated the Cat.</p>

<p>"Think well of it, Pinocchio, for you are giving a kick to
fortune."</p>

<p>"To fortune!" repeated the Cat.</p>

<p>"Between to-day and to-morrow your five gold pieces would
have become two thousand."</p>

<p>"Two thousand!" repeated the Cat.</p>

<p>"But how is it possible that they could have become so
many?" asked Pinocchio, remaining with his mouth open
from astonishment.</p>

<p>"I will explain it to you at once," said the Fox. "You
must know that in the Land of the Owls there is a sacred field
called by everybody the Field of Miracles. In this field you
must dig a little hole, and you put into it, we will say one gold
piece. Then you cover up the hole with a little earth;
you water it with two pails of water from the fountain, then
sprinkle it with two pinches of salt, and when night comes
you can go quietly to bed. In the meanwhile, during the night,
the gold piece will grow and flower, and in the morning when
you return to the field, what do you find? You find a beautiful
tree laden with as many gold pieces as an ear of corn has grains
in the month of June."</p>

<p>"So that," said Pinocchio, more and more bewildered,
"supposing I buried my five gold pieces in that field, how
many should I find there the following morning?"</p>

<p>"That is exceedingly easy calculation," replied the Fox,
"a calculation that you can make on the ends of your fingers.
Suppose that every gold piece gives you an increase of five
hundred; multiply five hundred by five, and the following
morning will find you with two thousand five hundred shining
gold pieces in your pocket."</p>

<p>"Oh! how delightful!" cried Pinocchio, dancing for joy,
"As soon as ever I have obtained those gold pieces, I will keep
<span class="left"><a name="page409" id="page409"></a>[page&nbsp;409]</span>
two thousand for myself, and the other five hundred I will
make a present of to you two."</p>

<p>"A present to us?" cried the Fox with indignation, and
appearing much offended. "What are you dreaming of?"</p>

<p>"What are you dreaming of?" repeated the Cat.</p>

<p>"We do not work," said the Fox, "for dirty interest, we
work solely to enrich others."</p>

<p>"Others!" repeated the Cat.</p>

<p>"What good people!" thought Pinocchio to himself; and
forgetting there and then his papa, the new coat, the spelling-book,
and all his good resolutions, he said to the Fox and the
Cat:</p>

<p>"Let us be off at once. I will go with you."</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<h4>THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH</h4>


<p>They walked, and walked, and walked, until at last, towards
evening, they arrived dead tired at the Inn of The Red-Crawfish.</p>

<p>"Let us stop here, a little," said the Fox, "that we may
have something to eat and rest ourselves for an hour or two.
We will start again at midnight, so as to arrive at the Field
of Miracles by dawn to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>Having gone into the inn they all three sat down to table,
but none of them had any appetite.</p>

<p>The Cat, who was suffering from indigestion and feeling
seriously indisposed, could only eat thirty-five mullet with
tomato sauce, and four portions of tripe with Parmesan cheese;
and because she thought the tripe was not seasoned enough,
she asked three times for the butter and grated cheese!</p>

<p>The Fox would also willingly have picked a little, but as
his doctor had ordered him a strict diet, he was forced to content
himself simply with a hare dressed with a sweet and sour
sauce, and garnished lightly with fat chickens and early pullets.
After the hare he sent for a made dish of partridges, rabbits,
frogs, lizards, and other delicacies; he could not touch anything
<span class="left"><a name="page410" id="page410"></a>[page&nbsp;410]</span>
else. He had such a disgust for food, he said, that he
could put nothing to his lips.</p>

<p>The one who ate the least was Pinocchio. He asked for
some walnuts and a hunch of bread, and left everything on his
plate. The poor boy, whose thoughts were continually fixed
on the Field of Miracles, had got in anticipation an indigestion
of gold pieces.</p>

<p>When they had supped the Fox said to the host:</p>

<p>"Give us two good rooms, one for Mr. Pinocchio, and
the other for me and my companion. We will snatch a little
sleep before we leave. Remember, however, that at midnight
we wish to be called to continue our journey."</p>

<p>"Yes, gentlemen," answered the host, and he winked at
the Fox and the Cat as much as to say: "I know what you are
up to. We understand one another!"</p>

<p>No sooner had Pinocchio got into bed than he fell asleep
at once and began to dream. And he dreamt that he was in
the middle of a field, and the field was filled with shrubs covered
with clusters of gold pieces, and as they swung in the wind
they went zin, zin, zin, almost as if they would say: "Let who
will come and take us." But when Pinocchio was at the most
interesting moment, that is, just as he was stretching out his
hand to pick handfuls of those beautiful gold pieces and put
them in his pockets, he was suddenly wakened by three violent
blows on the door of his room.</p>

<p>It was the host who had come to tell him that midnight
had struck.</p>

<p>"Are my companions ready?" asked the puppet.</p>

<p>"Ready! Why, they left two hours ago."</p>

<p>"Why were they in such a hurry?"</p>

<p>"Because the Cat had received a message to say that her
eldest kitten was ill with chilblains on his feet, and was in
danger of death."</p>

<p>"Did they pay for supper?"</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of? They are too highly educated
to dream of offering such an insult to a gentleman like
you."</p>

<p>"What a pity! It is an insult that would have given me
<span class="left"><a name="page411" id="page411"></a>[page&nbsp;411]</span>
so much pleasure!" said Pinocchio, scratching his head. He
then asked:</p>

<p>"And where did my good friends say they would wait for
me?"</p>

<p>"At the Field of Miracles, to-morrow morning at daybreak."</p>

<p>Pinocchio paid a gold piece for his supper and that of his
companions and then he left.</p>

<p>Outside the inn it was so pitch dark that he had almost to
grope his way, for it was impossible to see a hand's breadth in
front of him. In the adjacent country not a leaf moved.
Only some night-birds flying across the road from one hedge
to the other brushed Pinocchio's nose with their wings as they
passed, which caused him so much terror that springing back,
he shouted: "Who goes there?" and the echo in the surrounding
hills repeated in the distance: "Who goes there? Who
goes there? Who goes there?" ...</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<h4>THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS</h4>


<p>He turned to look, and saw in the gloom two evil-looking
black figures completely enveloped in charcoal sacks. They
were running after him on tiptoe, and making great leaps like
two phantoms.</p>

<p>"Here they are in reality!" he said to himself, and not
knowing where to hide his gold pieces he put them in his mouth
precisely under his tongue.</p>

<p>Then he tried to escape. But he had not gone a step when
he felt himself seized by the arm, and heard two sepulchral
voices saying to him:</p>

<p>"Your money or your life!"</p>

<p>Pinocchio, not being able to answer in words, owing to the
money in his mouth, made a thousand low bows and a thousand
pantomimes. He tried thus to make the two muffled figures,
whose eyes were only visible through the holes in their sacks,
<span class="left"><a name="page412" id="page412"></a>[page&nbsp;412]</span>
understand that he was a poor puppet, and that he had not as
much as a false penny in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Come now! Less nonsense and out with the money!"
cried the two brigands threateningly.</p>

<p>And the puppet made a gesture with his hands to signify
"I have got none."</p>

<p>"Deliver up your money or you are dead," said the tallest
of the brigands.</p>

<p>"Dead!" repeated the other.</p>

<p>"And after we have killed you, we will also kill your father!"</p>

<p>"Also your father!"</p>

<p>"No, no, no, not my poor papa!" cried Pinocchio in a
despairing tone; and as he said it, the gold pieces clinked in
his mouth.</p>

<p>"Ah! You rascal! Then you have hidden your money
under your tongue! Spit it out at once!"</p>

<p>But Pinocchio was obdurate.</p>

<p>And one of them seized the puppet by the end of his nose,
and the other took him by the chin, and began to pull them
brutally, the one up, and the other down, to constrain him to
open his mouth, but it was all to no purpose. Pinocchio's
mouth seemed to be nailed and riveted together.</p>

<p>Then the shortest assassin drew out an ugly knife and
tried to force it between his lips like a lever or chisel. But
Pinocchio as quick as lightning caught his hand with his teeth,
and with one bite bit it clean off and spat it out. Imagine his
astonishment when instead of a hand he perceived that he had
spat a cat's paw on to the ground.</p>

<p>Encouraged by his first victory he used his nails to such
purpose that he succeeded in liberating himself from his assailants,
and jumping the hedge by the roadside he began to
fly across the country. The assassins ran after him like two
dogs chasing a hare; and the one who had lost the paw ran on
one leg and no one ever knew how he managed it.</p>

<p>After a race of some miles Pinocchio could do no more.
Giving himself up for lost he climbed the stem of a very high
pine-tree and seated himself in the topmost branches. The
assassins attempted to climb after him, but when they had
<span class="left"><a name="page413" id="page413"></a>[page&nbsp;413]</span>
reached halfway up the stem they slid down again, and arrived
on the ground with the skin grazed from their hands and knees.</p>

<p>But they were not to be beaten by so little; collecting a
quantity of dry wood they piled it beneath the pine and set
fire to it. In less time than it takes to tell the pine began to
burn and flame like a candle blown by the wind. Pinocchio,
seeing that the flames were mounting higher every instant,
and not wishing to end his life like a roasted pigeon, made a
stupendous leap from the top of the tree and started afresh
across the fields and vineyards. The assassins followed him,
and kept behind him without once giving in.</p>

<p>The day began to break and they were still pursuing him.
Suddenly Pinocchio found his way barred by a wide, deep ditch
full of dirty water the color of coffee. What was he to do?
"One! two! three!" cried the puppet, and making a rush he
sprang to the other side. The assassins also jumped, but not
having measured the distance properly&mdash;splash, splash!...
they fell into the very middle of the ditch. Pinocchio who heard
the plunge and the splashing of water, shouted out, laughing
and without stopping:</p>

<p>"A fine bath to you, gentlemen assassins."</p>

<p>He felt convinced that they were drowned, when, turning
to look he perceived that, on the contrary, they were
both running after him, still enveloped in their sacks with the
water dripping from them as if they had been two hollow
baskets....</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<h4>THE FOX AND THE CAT</h4>


<p>Pinocchio set out; and as soon as he was in the wood he
began to run like a kid. But when he had reached a certain
spot, almost in front of the Big Oak, he stopped because he
thought that he heard people amongst the bushes. In fact,
two persons came out on the road. Can you guess who
they were?... His two traveling companions, the Fox and
the Cat, with whom he had supped at the Inn of the Red-Crawfish.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page414" id="page414"></a>[page&nbsp;414]</span>
<p>
"Why here is our dear Pinocchio!" cried the Fox, kissing
and embracing him. "How come you to be here?"</p>

<p>"How come you to be here?" repeated the Cat.</p>

<p>"It is a long story," answered the puppet, "which I will
tell you when I have time. But do you know that the other
night, when you left me alone at the inn, I met with assassins
on the road."</p>

<p>"Assassins!... Oh, poor Pinocchio! And what did
they want?"</p>

<p>"They wanted to rob me of my gold pieces."</p>

<p>"Villains!" said the Fox.</p>

<p>"Infamous villains!" repeated the Cat.</p>

<p>"But I ran away from them," continued the puppet, "and
they followed me, and at last they overtook me and hung me
to a branch of that oak-tree."</p>

<p>And Pinocchio pointed to the Big Oak, which was two
steps from them.</p>

<p>"Is it possible to hear of anything more dreadful?" said
the Fox. "In what a world we are condemned to live! Where
can respectable people like us find a safe refuge?"</p>

<p>Whilst they were thus talking Pinocchio observed that the
Cat was lame of her front right leg, for in fact she had lost her
paw with all its claws. He therefore asked her:</p>

<p>"What have you done with your paw!"</p>

<p>The Cat tried to answer but became confused. Therefore
the Fox said immediately:</p>

<p>"My friend is too modest, and that is why she doesn't
speak. I will answer for her. I must tell you that an hour
ago we met an old wolf on the road, almost fainting from
want of food, who asked alms of us. Not having so much as a
fish-bone to give to him, what did my friend, who has really
the heart of a C&aelig;sar, do? She bit off one of her forepaws,
and threw it to that poor beast that he might appease his
hunger."</p>

<p>And the Fox, in relating this, dried a tear.</p>

<p>Pinocchio was also touched, and approaching the Cat he
whispered into her ear:</p>

<p>"If all cats resemble you, how fortunate the mice would be!"</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page415" id="page415"></a>[page&nbsp;415]</span>

<p>"And now, what are you doing here?" asked the Fox of
the puppet.</p>

<p>"I am waiting for my papa, whom I expect to arrive every
moment."</p>

<p>"And your gold pieces?"</p>

<p>"I have got them in my pocket, all but one that I spent at
the Inn of the Red-Crawfish."</p>

<p>"And to think that, instead of four pieces, by to-morrow
they might become one or two thousand! Why do you not
listen to my advice? why will you not go and bury them in the
Field of Miracles?"</p>

<p>"To-day it is impossible, I will go another day."</p>

<p>"Another day it will be too late!" said the Fox.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because the field has been bought by a gentleman, and
after to-morrow no one will be allowed to bury money there."</p>

<p>"How far off is the Field of Miracles?"</p>

<p>"Not two miles. Will you come with us? In half an hour
you will be there. You can bury your money at once, and in
a few minutes you will collect two thousand, and this evening
you will return with your pockets full. Will you come with
us?"</p>

<p>Pinocchio thought of the good Fairy, old Geppetto, and
the warning of the Talking-cricket, and he hesitated a little
before answering. He ended however, by doing as all boys
do who have not a grain of sense and who have no heart&mdash;he
ended by giving his head a little shake, and saying to the Fox
and Cat:</p>

<p>"Let us go: I will come with you."</p>

<p>And they went.</p>

<p>After having walked half the day they reached a town
that was called "Trap for Blockheads." As soon as Pinocchio
entered this town, he saw that the streets were crowded with
dogs who had lost their coats and who were yawning from
hunger, shorn sheep trembling with cold, cocks without combs
or crests who were begging for a grain of Indian corn, large
butterflies who could no longer fly because they had sold their
beautiful colored wings, peacocks who had no tails and were
<span class="left"><a name="page416" id="page416"></a>[page&nbsp;416]</span>
ashamed to be seen, and pheasants who went scratching about
in a subdued fashion, mourning for their brilliant gold and
silver feathers gone for ever.</p>

<p>In the midst of this crowd of beggars and shamefaced
creatures, some lordly carriage passed from time to time containing
a Fox, or a thieving Magpie, or some other ravenous
bird of prey.</p>

<p>"And where is the Field of Miracles?" asked Pinocchio.</p>

<p>"It is here, not two steps from us."</p>

<p>They crossed the town, and having gone beyond the walls they
came to a solitary field which to look at resembled all other fields.</p>

<p>"We are arrived," said the Fox to the puppet. "Now
stoop down and dig with your hands a little hole in the ground
and put your gold pieces into it."</p>

<p>Pinocchio obeyed. He dug a hole, put into it the four gold
pieces that he had left, and then filled up the hole with a
little earth.</p>

<p>"Now, then," said the Fox, "go to that canal close to us,
fetch a can of water, and water the ground where you have
sowed them."</p>

<p>Pinocchio went to the canal, and as he had no can he took
off one of his old shoes and filling it with water he watered the
ground over the hole.</p>

<p>He then asked:</p>

<p>"Is there anything else to be done?"</p>

<p>"Nothing else," answered the Fox. "We can now go
away. You can return in about twenty minutes, and you will
find a shrub already pushing through the ground, with its
branches quite loaded with money."</p>

<p>The poor puppet, beside himself with joy, thanked the Fox
and the Cat a thousand times, and promised them a beautiful
present.</p>

<p>"We wish for no presents," answered the two rascals. "It
is enough for us to have taught you the way to enrich
yourself without undergoing hard work, and we are as happy
as folk out for a holiday."</p>

<p>Thus saying they took leave of Pinocchio, and wishing him
a good harvest went about their business.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page417" id="page417"></a>[page&nbsp;417]</span>


<h3>X</h3>

<h4>PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED</h4>


<p>The puppet returned to the town and began to count the
minutes one by one; and when he thought it must be time he
took the road leading to the Field of Miracles.</p>

<p>And as he walked along with hurried steps his heart beat
fast, tic, tac, tic, tac, like a drawing-room clock when it is really
going well. Meanwhile he was thinking to himself:</p>

<p>"And if instead of a thousand gold pieces, I was to find on
the branches of the tree two thousand?... And instead of
two thousand supposing I found five thousand? and instead
of five thousand that I found a hundred thousand? Oh!
what a fine gentleman I should then become!... I would
have a beautiful palace, a thousand little wooden horses and a
thousand stables to amuse myself with, a cellar full of currant-wine,
and sweet syrups, and a library quite full of candies,
tarts, plum-cakes, macaroons, and biscuits with cream."</p>

<p>Whilst he was building these castles in the air he had arrived
in the neighborhood of the field, and he stopped to look if by
chance he could perceive a tree with its branches laden with
money; but he saw nothing. He advanced another hundred
steps&mdash;nothing; he entered the field ... he went right up to
the little hole where he had buried his gold pieces&mdash;and nothing.
He then became very thoughtful, and forgetting the rules of
society and good manners he took his hands out of his pockets
and gave his head a long scratch.</p>

<p>At that moment he heard an explosion of laughter close to
him, and looking up he saw a large Parrot perched on a tree,
who was preening the few feathers he had left.</p>

<p>"Why are you laughing?" asked Pinocchio in an angry
voice.</p>

<p>"I am laughing because in preening my feathers I tickled
myself under my wings."</p>

<p>The puppet did not answer, but went to the canal and,
filling the same old shoe full of water, he proceeded to water
the earth afresh that covered his gold pieces.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page418" id="page418"></a>[page&nbsp;418]</span>
<p>
Whilst he was thus occupied another laugh, and still more
impertinent than the first, rang out in the silence of that solitary
place.</p>

<p>"Once for all," shouted Pinocchio in a rage, "may I know,
you ill-educated Parrot, what are you laughing at?"</p>

<p>"I am laughing at those simpletons who believe in all the
foolish things that are told them, and who allow themselves to
be entrapped by those who are more cunning than they are."</p>

<p>"Are you perhaps speaking of me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am speaking of you, poor Pinocchio&mdash;of you who
are simple enough to believe that money can be sown and
gathered in fields in the same way as beans and gourds. I
also believed it once, and to-day I am suffering for it. To-day&mdash;but
it is too late&mdash;I have at last learnt that to put a few
pennies honestly together it is necessary to know how to earn
them, either by the work of our own hands or by the cleverness
of our own brains."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," said the puppet who was already
trembling with fear.</p>

<p>"Have patience! I will explain myself better," rejoined
the Parrot. "You must know, then, that whilst you were in
the town the Fox and the Cat returned to the field; they took
the buried money and then fled like the wind. And now he
that catches them will be clever."</p>

<p>Pinocchio remained with his mouth open, and not choosing
to believe the Parrot's words he began with his hands and nails
to dig up the earth that he had watered. And he dug, and dug,
and dug, and made such a deep hole that a rick of straw might
have stood up in it; but the money was no longer there.</p>

<p>He rushed back to the town in a state of desperation, and
went at once to the Courts of Justice to denounce the two knaves
who had robbed him to the judge.</p>

<p>The judge was a big ape of the gorilla tribe&mdash;an old ape
respectable for his age, his white beard, but especially for his
gold spectacles without glasses that he always was obliged to
wear, on account of an inflammation of the eyes that had tormented
him for many years.</p>

<p>Pinocchio related in the presence of the judge all the particulars
<span class="left"><a name="page419" id="page419"></a>[page&nbsp;419]</span>
of the infamous fraud of which he had been the victim.
He gave the names, the surnames, and other details, of the two
rascals, and ended by demanding justice.</p>

<p>The judge listened with great benignity; took a lively interest
in the story; and was much touched and moved; and when
the puppet had nothing further to say he stretched out his hand
and rang a bell.</p>

<p>At this summons two mastiffs immediately appeared dressed
as gendarmes. The judge then, pointing to Pinocchio said
to them:</p>

<p>"That poor devil has been robbed of four gold pieces;
take him up, and put him immediately into prison."</p>

<p>The puppet was petrified on hearing this unexpected sentence,
and tried to protest; but the gendarmes, to avoid losing
time, stopped his mouth, and carried him off to the lockup.</p>

<p>And there he remained for four months&mdash;four long months&mdash;and
he would have remained longer still if a fortunate chance
had not released him. For I must tell you that the young
Emperor who reigned over the town of "Trap for Blockheads,"
having won a splendid victory over his enemies, ordered great
public rejoicings. There were illuminations, fire-works, horse
races, and velocipede races, and as a further sign of triumph
he commanded that the prisons should be opened and all
prisoners liberated.</p>

<p>"If the others are to be let out of prison, I will go also,"
said Pinocchio to the jailor.</p>

<p>"No, not you," said the jailor, "because you do not belong
to the fortunate class."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," replied Pinocchio, "I am also a
criminal."</p>

<p>"In that case you are perfectly right," said the jailor; and
taking off his hat and bowing to him respectfully he opened the
prison door and let him escape.</p>

<h1>JAPANESE STORIES</h1>

<hr class="short" />

<h2>THE STORY OF THE MAN WHO DID NOT WISH TO DIE</h2>

<h4>ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">L</span></p>
<p><b>ONG</b>, long ago there lived a man called Sentaro. His surname
meant "Millionaire," but although he was not so
rich as all that, he was still very far removed from being poor.
He had inherited a small fortune from his father and lived on
this, spending his time carelessly, without any serious thoughts
of work, till he was about thirty-two years of age.</p>

<p>One day, without any reason whatsoever, the thought of
death and sickness came to him. The idea of falling ill or
dying made him very wretched.</p>

<p>"I should like to live," he said to himself, "till I am five
or six hundred years old at least, free from all sickness. The
ordinary span of a man's life is very short."</p>

<p>He wondered whether it were possible, by living simply
and frugally henceforth, to prolong his life as long as he wished.</p>

<p>He knew there were many stories in ancient history of emperors
who had lived a thousand years, and there was a Princess
of Yamato, who it was said, lived to the age of five hundred.
This was the latest story of a very long life on record.</p>

<p>Sentaro had often heard the tale of the Chinese King
named Shin-no-Shiko. He was one of the most able and
powerful rulers in Chinese history. He built all the large
palaces, and also the famous great wall of China. He had
everything in the world he could wish for, but in spite of all
his happiness, and the luxury and splendor of his court, the
wisdom of his councilors and the glory of his reign, he was
miserable because he knew that one day he must die and
leave it all.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page421" id="page421"></a>[page&nbsp;421]</span>
<p>
When Shin-no-Shiko went to bed at night, when he rose
in the morning, as he went through his day, the thought of
death was always with him. He could not get away from it.
Ah&mdash;if only he could find the Elixir of Life, he would be
happy.</p>

<p>The Emperor at last called a meeting of his courtiers and
asked them all if they could not find for him the Elixir of
Life of which he had so often read and heard.</p>

<p>One old courtier, Jofuku by name, said that far away across
the seas there was a country called Horaizan, and that certain
hermits lived there who possessed the secret of the Elixir
of Life. Whoever drank of this wonderful draught lived forever.</p>

<p>The Emperor ordered Jofuku to set out for the land of Horaizan,
to find the hermits, and to bring him back a phial of the
magic elixir. He gave Jofuku one of his best junks, fitted
it out for him, and loaded it with great quantities of treasures
and precious stones for Jofuku to take as presents to the hermits.</p>

<p>Jofuku sailed for the land of Horaizan, but he never returned
to the waiting Emperor; but ever since that time Mount Fuji
has been said to be the fabled Horaizan and the home of hermits
who had the secret of the elixir, and Jofuku has been
worshipped as their patron god.</p>

<p>Now Sentaro determined to set out to find the hermits,
and if he could, to become one, so that he might obtain the water
of perpetual life. He remembered that as a child he had been
told that not only did these hermits live on Mount Fuji, but
that they were said to inhabit all the very high peaks.</p>

<p>So he left his old home to the care of his relatives, and
started out on his quest. He traveled through all the mountainous
regions of the land, climbing to the tops of the highest
peaks, but never a hermit did he find.</p>

<p>At last, after wandering in an unknown region for many
days, he met a hunter.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me," asked Sentaro, "where the hermits
live who have the Elixir of Life?"</p>

<p>"No," said the hunter; "I can't tell you where such hermits
<span class="left"><a name="page422" id="page422"></a>[page&nbsp;422]</span>
live, but there is a notorious robber living in these parts.
It is said that he is chief of a band of two hundred followers."</p>

<p>This odd answer irritated Sentaro very much, and he thought
how foolish it was to waste more time in looking for the hermits
in this way, so he decided to go at once to the shrine of
Jofuku, who is worshipped as the patron god of the hermits
in the South of Japan.</p>

<p>Sentaro reached the shrine and prayed for seven days,
entreating Jofuku to show him the way to a hermit who could
give him what he wanted so much to find.</p>

<p>At midnight of the seventh day, as Sentaro knelt in the
temple, the door of the innermost shrine flew open, and Jofuku
appeared in a luminous cloud, and calling to Sentaro to come
nearer, spoke thus:</p>

<p>"Your desire is a very selfish one and cannot be easily
granted. You think that you would like to become a hermit
so as to find the Elixir of Life. Do you know how hard a
hermit's life is? A hermit is only allowed to eat fruit and
berries and the bark of pine trees; a hermit must cut himself
off from the world so that his heart may become as pure as
gold and free from every earthly desire. Gradually after
following these strict rules, the hermit ceases to feel hunger
or cold or heat, and his body becomes so light that he can ride
on a crane or a carp, and can walk on water without getting
his feet wet.</p>

<p>"You, Sentaro, are fond of good living and of every comfort.
You are not even like an ordinary man, for you are exceptionally
idle, and more sensitive to heat and cold than most people.
You would never be able to go barefoot or to wear only one
thin garment in the winter time! Do you think that you would
ever have the patience or the endurance to live a hermit's
life?</p>

<p>"In answer to your prayer, however, I will help you in
another way. I will send you to the country of Perpetual
Life, where death never comes&mdash;where the people live for
ever!"</p>

<p>Saying this, Jofuku put into Sentaro's hand a little crane
<span class="left"><a name="page423" id="page423"></a>[page&nbsp;423]</span>
made of paper, telling him to sit on its back and it would carry
him there.</p>

<p>Sentaro obeyed wonderingly. The crane grew large enough
for him to ride on it with comfort. It then spread its wings,
rose high in the air, and flew away over the mountains right
out to sea.</p>

<p>Sentaro was at first quite frightened; but by degrees he
grew accustomed to the swift flight through the air. On and
on they went for thousands of miles. The bird never stopped
for rest or food, but as it was a paper bird it doubtless did not
require any nourishment, and strange to say, neither did Sentaro.</p>

<p>After several days they reached an island. The crane flew
some distance inland and then alighted.</p>

<p>As soon as Sentaro got down from the bird's back, the
crane folded up of its own accord and flew into his pocket.</p>

<p>Now Sentaro began to look about him wonderingly, curious
to see what the country of Perpetual Life was like. He walked
first round about the country and then through the town.
Everything was, of course, quite strange, and different from his
own land. But both the land and the people seemed prosperous,
so he decided that it would be good for him to stay
there and took up lodgings at one of the hotels.</p>

<p>The proprietor was a kind man, and when Sentaro told
him that he was a stranger and had come to live there, he
promised to arrange everything that was necessary with the
governor of the city concerning Sentaro's sojourn there. He
even found a house for his guest, and in this way Sentaro obtained
his great wish and became a resident in the country
of Perpetual Life.</p>

<p>Within the memory of all the islanders no man had ever
died there, and sickness was a thing unknown. Priests had
come over from India and China and told them of a beautiful
country called Paradise, where happiness and bliss and contentment
fill all men's hearts, but its gates could only be reached
by dying. This tradition was handed down for ages from
generation to generation&mdash;but none knew exactly what death
was except that it led to Paradise.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page424" id="page424"></a>[page&nbsp;424]</span>

<p>Quite unlike Sentaro and other ordinary people, instead of
having a great dread of death, they all, both rich and poor,
longed for it as something good and desirable. They were
all tired of their long, long lives, and longed to go to the happy
land of contentment called Paradise of which the priests had
told them centuries ago.</p>

<p>All this Sentaro soon found out by talking to the islanders.
He found himself, according to his ideas, in the land of
<i>Topsy-turvydom</i>.
Everything was upside down. He had wished to
escape from dying. He had come to the land of Perpetual
Life with great relief and joy, only to find that the inhabitants
themselves, doomed never to die, would consider it bliss to
find death.</p>

<p>What he had hitherto considered poison these people ate
as good food, and all the things to which he had been accustomed
as food they rejected. Whenever any merchants from
other countries arrived, the rich people rushed to them eager
to buy poisons. These they swallowed eagerly hoping for
death to come so that they might go to Paradise.</p>

<p>But what were deadly poisons in other lands were without
effect in this strange place, and people who swallowed them
with the hope of dying, only found that in a short time they
felt better in health instead of worse.</p>

<p>Vainly they tried to imagine what death could be like.
The wealthy would have given all their money and all their
goods if they could but shorten their lives to two or three hundred
years even. Without any change, to live on forever, seemed
to this people wearisome and sad.</p>

<p>In the drug-shops there was a drug which was in constant
demand, because after using it for a hundred years, it was
supposed to turn the hair slightly gray and to bring about
disorders of the stomach.</p>

<p>Sentaro was astonished to find that the poisonous globe-fish
was served up in restaurants as a delectable dish, and hawkers
in the streets went about selling sauces made of Spanish
flies. He never saw anyone ill after eating these horrible things,
nor did he ever see anyone with as much as a cold.</p>

<p>Sentaro was delighted. He said to himself that he would
<span class="left"><a name="page425" id="page425"></a>[page&nbsp;425]</span>
never grow tired of living, and that he considered it profane to
wish for death. He was the only happy man on the island.
For his part he wished to live thousands of years and to enjoy
life. He set himself up in business, and for the present never
even dreamed of going back to his native land.</p>

<p>As years went by, however, things did not go as smoothly
as at first. He had heavy losses in business, and several times
some affairs went wrong with his neighbors. This caused him
great annoyance.</p>

<p>Time passed like the flight of an arrow for him, for he was
busy from morning till night. Three hundred years went by
in this monotonous way, and then at last he began to grow
tired of life in this country, and he longed to see his own land
and his old home. However long he lived here, life would
always be the same, so was it not foolish and wearisome to
stay on here for ever?</p>

<p>Sentaro, in his wish to escape from the country of Perpetual
Life, recollected Jofuku, who had helped him before
when he was wishing to escape from death&mdash;and he prayed
to the saint to bring him back to his own land again.</p>

<p>No sooner did he pray than the paper crane popped out of
his pocket. Sentaro was amazed to see that it had remained
undamaged after all these years. Once more the bird grew
and grew till it was large enough for him to mount it. As he
did so, the bird spread its wings and flew swiftly out across the
sea in the direction of Japan.</p>

<p>Such was the wilfulness of the man's nature that he looked
back and regretted all he had left behind. He tried to stop
the bird in vain. The crane held on its way for thousands
of miles across the ocean.</p>

<p>Then a storm came on, and the wonderful paper crane got
damp, crumpled up, and fell into the sea. Sentaro fell with it.
Very much frightened at the thought of being drowned, he
cried out loudly to Jofuku to save him. He looked round, but
there was no ship in sight. He swallowed a quantity of sea-water,
which only increased his miserable plight. While he
was thus struggling to keep himself afloat, he saw a monstrous
shark swimming towards him. As it came nearer it opened
<span class="left"><a name="page426" id="page426"></a>[page&nbsp;426]</span>
its huge mouth ready to devour him. Sentaro was all but paralyzed
with fear now that he felt his end so near, and screamed out
as loudly as ever he could to Jofuku to come and rescue him.</p>

<p>Lo, and behold, Sentaro was awakened by his own screams,
to find that during his long prayer he had fallen asleep before
the shrine, and that all his extraordinary and frightful adventures
had been only a wild dream. He was in a cold perspiration
with fright, and utterly bewildered.</p>

<p>Suddenly a bright light came towards him, and in the light
stood a messenger. The messenger held a book in his hand
and spoke to Sentaro:</p>

<p>"I am sent to you by Jofuku, who in answer to your prayer,
has permitted you in a dream to see the land of Perpetual Life.
But you grew weary of living there, and begged to be allowed
to return to your native land so that you might die. Jofuku,
so that he might try you, allowed you to drop into the sea, and
then sent a shark to swallow you up. Your desire for death
was not real, for even at that moment you cried out loudly and
shouted for help.</p>

<p>"It is also vain for you to wish to become a hermit, or to
find the Elixir of Life. These things are not for such as you&mdash;your
life is not austere enough. It is best for you to go back
to your paternal home, and to live a good and industrious
life. Never neglect to keep the anniversaries of your ancestors,
and make it your duty to provide for your children's future.
Thus will you live to a good old age and be happy, but give up
the vain desire to escape death, for no man can do that, and by
this time you have surely found out that even when selfish
desires are granted they do not bring happiness.</p>

<p>"In this book I give you there are many precepts good for
you to know&mdash;if you study them, you will be guided in the way
I have pointed out to you."</p>

<p>The angel disappeared as soon as he had finished speaking,
and Sentaro took the lesson to heart. With the book in his
hand he returned to his old home, and giving up all his old
vain wishes, tried to live a good and useful life and to observe
the lessons taught him in the book, and he and his house prospered
henceforth.</p>

<h2>THE ACCOMPLISHED AND LUCKY TEAKETTLE</h2>

<h4>ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">A</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>LONG</b> time ago, at a temple called Morinji, in the province
of Jh&ocirc;siu, there was an old teakettle. One day, when the
priest of the temple was about to hang it over the hearth to boil the
water for his tea, to his amazement the kettle all of a sudden
put forth the head and tail of a badger. What a wonderful
kettle, to come out all over fur! The priest, thunderstruck,
called in the novices of the temple to see the sight; and whilst
they were stupidly staring, one suggesting one thing and another
another, the kettle, jumping up into the air, began flying about
the room. More astonished than ever, the priest and his pupils
tried to pursue it; but no thief or cat was ever half so sharp as
this wonderful badger-kettle. At last, however, they managed
to knock it down and secure it; and, holding it in with their
united efforts, they forced it into a box, intending to carry it
off and throw it away in some distant place, so that they might
be no more plagued by the goblin. For this day their troubles
were over; but, as luck would have it, the tinker who was in
the habit of working for the temple called in, and the priest
suddenly bethought him that it was a pity to throw the kettle
away for nothing, and that he might as well get a trifle for it,
no matter how small. So he brought out the kettle, which
had resumed its former shape and had got rid of its head and tail,
and showed it to the tinker. When the tinker saw the kettle,
he offered twenty copper coins for it, and the priest was only
too glad to close the bargain and be rid of his troublesome
piece of furniture. But the tinker trudged off home with his
pack and his new purchase. That night, as he lay asleep, he
heard a strange noise near his pillow; so he peered out from
under the bedclothes, and there he saw the kettle that he had
bought in the temple covered with fur, and walking about on
four legs. The tinker started up in a fright to see what it could
all mean, when all of a sudden the kettle resumed its former
<span class="left"><a name="page428" id="page428"></a>[page&nbsp;428]</span>
shape. This happened over and over again, until at last the
tinker showed the teakettle to a friend of his, who said: "This
is certainly an accomplished and lucky teakettle. You should
take it about as a show, with songs and accompaniments of
musical instruments, and make it dance and walk on the tight
rope."</p>

<p>The tinker, thinking this good advice, made arrangements
with a showman, and set up an exhibition. The noise of the
kettle's performances soon spread abroad, until even the
Princes of the land sent to order the tinker to come to them;
and he grew rich beyond all his expectations. Even the Princesses,
too, and the great ladies of the court, took great delight
in the dancing kettle, so that no sooner had it shown its tricks
in one place than it was time for them to keep some other engagement.
At last the tinker grew so rich that he took the
kettle back to the temple, where it was laid up as a precious
treasure, and worshiped as a saint.</p>

<h2>THE TONGUE-CUT SPARROW</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> upon a time a cross old woman laid some starch in
a basin, intending to put it in the clothes in her wash-tub;
but a Sparrow that a woman, her neighbor, kept as a pet, ate
it up. Seeing this, the cross old woman seized the Sparrow
and, saying "You hateful thing!" cut its tongue and let it go.</p>

<p>When the neighbor woman heard that her pet Sparrow had
got its tongue cut for its offense, she was greatly grieved, and
set out with her husband over mountains and plains to find
where it had gone, crying, "Where does the tongue-cut Sparrow
stay? Where does the tongue-cut Sparrow stay?"</p>

<p>At last they found its home. When the Sparrow saw that
its old master and mistress had come to see it, it rejoiced, and
brought them into its house and thanked them for their kindness
in old times. It spread a table for them, and loaded it
with rice wine and fish till there was no more room, and made
its wife and children and grandchildren all serve the table.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page429" id="page429"></a>[page&nbsp;429]</span>
<p>
At last, throwing away its drinking-cup, it danced a jig
called the Sparrow's dance, and thus they spent the day. When it
began to grow dark, and there was talk of going home, the
Sparrow brought out two wicker baskets and said, "Will
you take the heavy one, or shall I give you the light one?"
The old people replied, "We are old, so give us the light
one; it will be easier to carry it." The Sparrow then gave them
the light basket, and they returned with it to their home. "Let
us open and see what is in it," they said. And when they
had opened it and looked, they found gold and silver and jewels
and rolls of silk. They never expected anything like this.
The more they took out the more they found inside. The
supply was inexhaustible, so that the house at once became
rich and prosperous. When the cross old woman who had cut
the Sparrow's tongue saw this, she was filled with envy, and
went and asked her neighbor where the Sparrow lived and all
about the way. "I will go, too," she said, and at once set out
on her search.</p>

<p>Again the Sparrow brought out two wicker baskets, and
asked as before, "Will you take the heavy one, or shall I give
you the light one?"</p>

<p>Thinking the treasure would be great in proportion to the
weight of the basket, the old woman replied, "Let me have
the heavy one."</p>

<p>Receiving this, she started home with it on her back, the sparrows
laughing at her as she went. It was as heavy as a stone, and
hard to carry, but at last she got back with it to her house.</p>

<p>Then, when she took off the lid and looked in, a whole troop
of frightful creatures came bouncing out from the inside, and
at once they caught her up and flew away with her.</p>

<h2>BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">A</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>MONKEY</b> and a Crab once met when going round a
mountain.</p>

<p>The Monkey had picked up a persimmon-seed, and the
<span class="left"><a name="page430" id="page430"></a>[page&nbsp;430]</span>
Crab had a piece of toasted rice-cake. The Monkey, seeing
this, and wishing to get something that could be turned to
good account at once, said, "Pray, exchange that rice-cake for
this persimmon-seed." The Crab, without a word, gave up
his cake, and took the persimmon-seed and planted it. At
once it sprung up, and soon became a tree so high one had
to look far up to see it. The tree was full of persimmons,
but the Crab had no means of climbing it, so he asked the
Monkey to scramble up and get the fruit for him. The Monkey
got up on a limb of the tree and began to eat the persimmons.
The unripe ones he threw at the Crab, but all the ripe and
good ones he put in his pouch. The Crab under the tree thus
got his shell badly bruised, and only by good luck escaped into
his hole, where he lay distressed with pain, and not able to get
up. Now, when the relatives and household of the Crab
heard how matters stood, they were surprised and angry, and
declared war, and attacked the Monkey, who, leading forth a
numerous following, bade defiance to the other party. The
crabs, finding themselves unable to meet and cope with this
force, became still more exasperated and enraged, and retreated
into their hole and held a council of war. Then came
a rice-mortar, a pestle, a bee, and an egg, and together they
devised a deep-laid plot to be avenged.</p>

<p>First, they requested that peace be made with the crabs;
and thus they induced the king of the monkeys to enter their
hole unattended, and seated him on the hearth. The Monkey,
not suspecting any plot, took the <i>hibashi</i>, or poker, to stir up
the slumbering fire, when bang! went the egg, which was
lying hidden in the ashes, and burned the Monkey's arm.
Surprised and alarmed, he plunged his arm into the pickle-tub
in the kitchen to relieve the pain of the burn. Then the
bee which was hidden near the tub stung him sharply in his
face, already wet with tears. Without waiting to brush off
the bee, and howling bitterly, he rushed for the back door;
but just then some seaweed entangled his legs and made him
slip. Then down came the pestle, tumbling on him from a
shelf, and the mortar, too, came rolling down on him from
the roof of the porch and broke his back, and so weakened
<span class="left"><a name="page431" id="page431"></a>[page&nbsp;431]</span>
him that he was unable to rise up. Then out came the crabs
in a crowd, and brandishing on high their pinchers they pinched
the Monkey so sorely that he begged them for forgiveness and
promised never to repeat his meanness and treachery.</p>

<h2>MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">A</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>LONG</b> long time ago there lived an old man and an old
woman. One day the old man went to the mountains to
cut grass; and the old woman went to the river to wash clothes.
While she was washing a great thing came tumbling and
splashing down the stream. When the old woman saw it she
was very glad, and pulled it to her with a piece of bamboo
that lay near by. When she took it up and looked at it she
saw that it was a very large peach. She then quickly finished
her washing and returned home intending to give the peach
to her old man to eat.</p>

<p>When she cut the peach in two, out came a child from the
large kernel. Seeing this the old couple rejoiced, and named
the child Momotaro, or Little Peachling, because he came out
of a peach. As both the old people took good care of him,
he grew and became strong and enterprising. So the old
couple had their expectations raised, and bestowed still more
care on his education.</p>

<p>Momotaro finding that he excelled everybody in strength,
determined to cross over to the island of the devils, take their
riches, and come back. He at once consulted with the old
man and the old woman about the matter, and got them to make
him some dumplings. These he put in his pouch. Besides
this he made every kind of preparation for his journey to the
island of the devils and set out.</p>

<a name="page431b" id="page431b"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/0578.jpg"><img src="images/0578-285.jpg" width="285" height="450" alt="A Pheasant Also Came Flying and Said: 'Give Me a Dumpling.'" border="0" /></a><br /><br />
<p class="center"><b>A Pheasant Also Came Flying and Said: "Give Me a Dumpling."</b></p>
</div>

<p>Then first a dog came to the side of the way and said,
"Momotaro! What have you there hanging at your belt?"
He replied, "I have some of the very best Japanese millet
<span class="left"><a name="page432" id="page432"></a>[page&nbsp;432]</span>
dumplings." "Give me one and I will go with you," said the
dog. So Momotaro took a dumpling out of his pouch and
gave it to the dog. Then a monkey came and got one the same
way. A pheasant also came flying and said, "Give me a
dumpling too, and I will go along with you." So all three
went along with him. In no time they arrived at the island of
the devils, and at once broke through the front gate; Momotaro
first; then his three followers. Here they met a great
multitude of the devils' retainers who showed fight, but they
pressed still inwards, and at last encountered the chief of the
devils, called Akandoji. Then came the tug of war. Akandoji
hit at Momotaro with an iron club, but Momotaro was
ready for him, and dodged him adroitly. At last they grappled
each other, and without difficulty Momotaro just crushed down
Akandoji and tied him with a rope so tightly that he could not
even move. All this was done in a fair fight.</p>

<p>After this Akandoji the chief of the devils said he would
surrender all his riches. "Out with your riches then," said
Momotaro laughing. Having collected and ranged in order
a great pile of precious things, Momotaro took them, and set
out for his home, rejoicing, as he marched bravely back, that,
with the help of his three companions, to whom he attributed
all his success, he had been able so easily to accomplish his
end.</p>

<p>Great was the joy of the old man and the old woman when
Momotaro came back. He feasted everybody bountifully,
told many stories of his adventure, displayed his riches, and at
last became a leading man, a man of influence, very rich and
honorable; a man to be very much congratulated indeed!!</p>

<h2>URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">U</span></p>
<p><b>RASCHIMA</b> Taro, which means in Japanese "Son of the
Island," was the only and dearly beloved son of an old
fisherman and his wife:</p>

<p>He was a fine, strong youth, who could manage a boat
<span class="left"><a name="page433" id="page433"></a>[page&nbsp;433]</span>
more cleverly than any one else on the neighboring coast. He
often ventured so far out to sea that neighbors warned his
parents that he would sometime go too far and never return.</p>

<p>His parents knew, however, that he understood his boat
and the sea very well, and they were never much concerned
about him. Even when he failed to come back as soon as he
was expected, they awaited his return without anxiety. They
loved him better than their own lives, and were proud that he
was braver and stronger than their neighbors' sons.</p>

<p>Early one morning, Uraschima Taro went to haul in his
nets, which had been set the night before. In one of them,
among some fishes, he found a small turtle. This he placed
in the boat, by itself, where it would safely keep, until he could
take it home. To his amazement, the turtle begged for its
life in most pitiful tones. "Of what use am I to you?" it asked.
"I am too small to eat, and so young that it will take me a long
time to grow. Have mercy and put me back into the sea, for
I do not want to die." Uraschima Taro had a very kind heart
and could not bear to see anything that was small and helpless
suffer; so he did as the turtle asked him.</p>

<p>Several years after this, when Uraschima Taro was one
day far out at sea, a terrible whirlwind struck his boat and
shattered it. He was a good swimmer, and managed for a
long time to make progress toward the land; but as he was so
far from shore in the rough sea, his strength at last gave out
and he felt himself sinking. Just as he had given up hope,
and thought that he would never see his dear parents again,
he heard his name called and saw a large turtle swimming
toward him.</p>

<p>"Climb on my back," shouted the turtle, "and I will carry
you to land." When Uraschima Taro was safely sitting on the
turtle's back it continued: "I am the turtle whose life you saved
when you found me, little and helpless, in your net, and I am
glad of this opportunity to show that I am not ungrateful."</p>

<p>Before they reached the shore, the turtle asked Uraschima
Taro how he would like to be shown some of the wonderful
beauties hidden under the sea. The young fisherman replied
that the experience would please him. In a moment they were
<span class="left"><a name="page434" id="page434"></a>[page&nbsp;434]</span>
shooting down through the green water. He clung to the
turtle's back, who carried him many, many fathoms below.
After three nights they reached the bottom of the sea, and
came to a wonderful palace of gold and crystal. Coral and
pearls and precious stones dazzled his eyes; but inside, the palace
was more beautiful still, and blazing fish scales lighted it.</p>

<p>"This," said the turtle, "is the palace of the sea-god. I
am a waiting-maid to his lovely daughter, the Princess."</p>

<p>The turtle went to announce the arrival of Uraschima
Taro to the Princess, and soon returning, led him to her presence.
She was so beautiful that when she asked him to remain in
the palace he gladly consented.</p>

<p>"Do not leave me, and you shall always be as handsome
as you are now, and old age cannot come to you," she said.</p>

<p>So it happened that Uraschima Taro lived in the marvelous
palace at the bottom of the sea with the daughter of the sea-god.
He was so happy that the time passed by unheeded.
How long he dwelt there he could not have told. But one day
he thought of his parents; then he remembered that they must
be troubled by his absence. The thought of them kept coming
to him continually, and the longing to see them grew so strong
that at last he told the Princess he must go to visit them. She
begged him not to leave her and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>"If you go, I shall never see you again," she sobbed.</p>

<p>But he told her that he must see his father and mother
once again; then he would return to the palace in the sea, to
be with her always. When she found that she could not persuade
him to remain, she gave him a small gold box, which,
she told him, he must on no account open.</p>

<p>"If you heed my words," said she, "you may come back
to me. When you are ready, the turtle will be there to bring
you; but if you forget what I have told you, I shall never see
you again."</p>

<p>Uraschima Taro fondly assured her that nothing in the world
should keep him from her, and bade her farewell. Mounting
the turtle's back, he soon left the palace far below. For three
days and three nights they swam, and then the turtle left him
on the familiar sands near his old home.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page435" id="page435"></a>[page&nbsp;435]</span>

<p>He eagerly ran to the village and looked about for some of
his comrades. All of the faces were strange, and even the
houses seemed different. The children, playing in the street
where he had lived, he had never seen before. Stopping in
front of his own house, he regarded it with a sinking heart.
There was the sound of music from a window above, and a
strange woman opened the door to him. She could tell him
nothing of his parents, and had never heard their names.
Every one whom he questioned looked at him curiously. At
last he wandered from the village and came to the burying
ground. Searching about among the graves, he soon found
himself beside a stone bearing the dear names he sought. The
date showed him that his father and mother had died soon
after he left them; and then he discovered that he had been
away from his home three hundred years. Bowed with sorrow,
he went back to the city. At each step he hoped to
wake and find it all a dream, but the people and streets were
real.</p>

<p>He thought of the Princess, and remembered the gold box
she had given to him. It might be that he was under some
cruel enchantment, and that this box contained the charm to
break the spell. He eagerly raised the cover, and a purple
vapor escaped and left the box empty. To his alarm, he noticed
that the hand that held it had shriveled and grown suddenly
old. Trembling with horror, he ran to a stream of water
which ran down from the mountain, and saw reflected in its
waters the face of a mummy.</p>

<p>He crawled fearfully back to the village, and no one recognized
him as the strong youth who had entered it a few hours
before. Nearly exhausted; he finally reached the shore, where
he sat wearily on a rock and cried to the turtle. But he called
to it in vain; the turtle never came, and soon his quavering
voice was hushed in death.</p>

<p>Before he died, the people of the village gathered about
him and listened to his strange story. Long afterward they
told their children of the young man who, for the love of his
parents, left a marvelous palace in the sea, and a Princess more
beautiful than the day.</p>

<h2>THE SON OF SEVEN QUEENS</h2>

<h4>ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> upon a time there lived a King who had seven Queens,
but no children. This was a great grief to him, especially
when he remembered that on his death there would be no heir
to inherit the kingdom.</p>

<p>Now it happened one day that a poor old fakir came to the
King and said, "Your prayers are heard, your desire shall be
accomplished, and one of your seven Queens shall bear a son."</p>

<p>The King's delight at this promise knew no bounds, and he
gave orders for appropriate festivities to be prepared against
the coming event throughout the length and breadth of the
land.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the seven Queens lived luxuriously in a splendid
palace, attended by hundreds of female slaves, and fed to their
hearts' content on sweetmeats and confectionery.</p>

<p>Now the King was very fond of hunting, and one day, before
he started, the seven Queens sent him a message saying, "May
it please our dearest lord not to hunt toward the north to-day,
for we have dreamed bad dreams, and fear lest evil should
befall you."</p>

<p>The King, to allay their anxiety, promised regard for their
wishes, and set out toward the south; but as luck would have
it, although he hunted diligently, he found no game. Nor
had he more success to the east or west, so that, being a keen
sportsman, and determined not to go home empty-handed, he
forgot all about his promise and turned to the north. Here
also he was at first unsuccessful, but just as he had made up
his mind to give up for that day, a white hind with golden
<span class="left"><a name="page437" id="page437"></a>[page&nbsp;437]</span>
horns and silver hoofs flashed past him into a thicket. So
quickly did it pass that he scarcely saw it; nevertheless, a burning
desire to capture and possess the beautiful strange creature
filled his breast. He instantly ordered his attendants to form
a ring round the thicket, and so encircle the hind; then, gradually
narrowing the circle, he pressed forward till he could distinctly
see the white hind panting in the midst. Nearer and
nearer he advanced, till just as he thought to lay hold of the
beautiful strange creature, it gave one mighty bound, leaped
clean over the King's head, and fled toward the mountains.
Forgetful of all else, the King, setting spurs to his horse, followed
at full speed. On, on he galloped, leaving his retinue
far behind, keeping the white hind in view, never drawing
bridle until, finding himself in a narrow ravine with no outlet,
he reined in his steed. Before him stood a miserable hovel,
into which, being tired after his long, unsuccessful chase, he
entered to ask for a drink of water. An old woman, seated
in the hut at a spinning-wheel, answered his request by calling
to her daughter, and immediately from an inner room came a
maiden so lovely and charming, so white-skinned and golden-haired,
that the King was transfixed by astonishment at seeing
so beautiful a sight in the wretched hovel.</p>

<p>She held the vessel of water to the King's lips, and as he
drank he looked into her eyes, and then it became clear to him
that the girl was no other than the white hind with the golden
horns and silver feet he had chased so far.</p>

<p>Her beauty bewitched him, so he fell on his knees, begging
her to return with him as his bride; but she only laughed, saying
seven Queens were quite enough even for a King to manage.
However, when he would take no refusal, but implored her to
have pity on him, promising her everything she could desire,
she replied, "Give me the eyes of your seven Queens, and
then perhaps I may believe you mean what you say."</p>

<p>The King was so carried away by the glamor of the white
hind's magical beauty that he went home at once, had the
eyes of his seven Queens taken out, and, after throwing the
poor blind creatures into a noisome dungeon whence they could
not escape, set off once more for the hovel in the ravine, bearing
<span class="left"><a name="page438" id="page438"></a>[page&nbsp;438]</span>
with him his horrible offering. But the white hind only
laughed cruelly when she saw the fourteen eyes, and threading
them as a necklace, flung it round her mother's neck, saying,
"Wear that, little mother, as a keepsake, while I am away in
the King's palace."</p>

<p>Then she went back with the bewitched Monarch, as his
bride, and he gave her the seven Queens' rich clothes and jewels
to wear, the seven Queens' palace to live in, and the seven
Queens' slaves to wait upon her; so that she really had everything
even a witch could desire.</p>

<p>Now, very soon after the seven wretched hapless Queens had
their eyes torn out, and were cast into prison, a baby was born
to the youngest of the Queens. It was a handsome boy, but the
other Queens were very jealous that the youngest among them
should be so fortunate. But though at first they disliked the
handsome little boy, he soon proved so useful to them, that ere
long they all looked on him as their son. Almost as soon as
he could walk about he began scraping at the mud wall of their
dungeon, and in an incredibly short space of time had made
a hole big enough for him to crawl through. Through this he
disappeared, returning in an hour or so laden with sweetmeats,
which he divided equally among the seven blind Queens.</p>

<p>As he grew older he enlarged the hole, and slipped out two
or three times every day to play with the little nobles in the
town. No one knew who the tiny boy was, but everybody
liked him, and he was so full of funny tricks and antics, so
merry and bright, that he was sure to be rewarded by some
girdle-cakes, a handful of parched grain, or some sweetmeats.
All these, things he brought home to his seven mothers, as he
loved to call the seven blind Queens, who by his help lived on
in their dungeon when all the world thought they had starved
to death ages before.</p>

<p>At last, when he was quite a big lad, he one day took his
bow and arrow, and went out to seek for game. Coming by
chance past the palace where the white hind lived in wicked
splendor and magnificence, he saw some pigeons fluttering
round the white marble turrets, and, taking good aim, shot one
dead. It came tumbling past the very window where the
<span class="left"><a name="page439" id="page439"></a>[page&nbsp;439]</span>
white Queen was sitting; she rose to see what was the matter,
and looked out. At the first glance of the handsome young
lad standing there bow in hand, she knew by witchcraft that
it was the King's son.</p>

<p>She nearly died of envy and spite, determining to destroy
the lad without delay; therefore, sending a servant to bring
him to her presence, she asked him if he would sell her the
pigeon he had just shot.</p>

<p>"No," replied the sturdy lad, "the pigeon is for my seven
blind mothers, who live in the noisome dungeon, and who
would die if I did not bring them food."</p>

<p>"Poor souls!" cried the cunning white witch. "Would
you not like to bring them their eyes again? Give me the pigeon,
my dear, and I faithfully promise to show you where to find
them."</p>

<p>Hearing this, the lad was delighted beyond measure, and
gave up the pigeon at once. Whereupon the white Queen told
him to seek her mother without delay, and ask for the eyes
which she wore as a necklace.</p>

<p>"She will not fail to give them," said the cruel Queen, "if
you show her this token on which I have written what I want
done."</p>

<p>So saying, she gave the lad a piece of broken potsherd, with
these words inscribed on it, "Kill the bearer at once, and
sprinkle his blood like water!"</p>

<p>Now, as the son of seven Queens could not read, he took
the fatal message cheerfully, and set off to find the white Queen's
mother.</p>

<p>While he was journeying he passed through a town where
every one of the inhabitants looked so sad that he could not
help asking what was the matter. They told him it was because
the King's only daughter refused to marry; therefore
when her father died there would be no heir to the throne.
They greatly feared she must be out of her mind, for though
every good-looking young man in the kingdom had been shown
to her, she declared she would only marry one who was the son
of seven mothers, and who had ever heard of such a thing?
The King, in despair, had ordered every man who entered
<span class="left"><a name="page440" id="page440"></a>[page&nbsp;440]</span>
the city gates to be led before the Princess; so, much to the lad's
impatience, for he was in an immense hurry to find his mothers'
eyes, he was dragged into the presence-chamber.</p>

<p>No sooner did the Princess catch sight of him than she
blushed, and, turning to the King, said, "Dear father, this is
my choice!"</p>

<p>Never were such rejoicings as these few words produced.
The inhabitants nearly went wild with joy, but the son of seven
Queens said he would not marry the Princess unless they first
let him recover his mothers' eyes. When the beautiful bride
heard his story, she asked to see the potsherd, for she was very
learned and clever. Seeing the treacherous words, she said
nothing, but taking another similar-shaped bit of potsherd, she
wrote on it these words, "Take care of this lad, giving him
all he desires," and returned it to the son of seven Queens, who,
none the wiser, set off on his quest.</p>

<p>Ere long he arrived at the hovel in the ravine where the
white witch's mother, a hideous old creature, grumbled dreadfully
on reading the message, especially when the lad asked
for the necklace of eyes. Nevertheless she took it off and gave
it him, saying, "There are only thirteen of 'em now, for I
lost one last week."</p>

<p>The lad, however, was only too glad to get any at all, so
he hurried home as fast as he could to his seven mothers, and
gave two eyes apiece to the six elder Queens; but to the youngest
he gave one, saying, "Dearest little mother!&mdash;I will be your
other eye always!"</p>

<p>After this he set off to marry the Princess, as he had promised,
but when passing by the white Queen's palace he saw
some pigeons on the roof. Drawing his bow, he shot one,
and it came fluttering past the window. The white hind
looked out, and lo! there was the King's son alive and well.</p>

<p>She cried with hatred and disgust, but sending for the
lad, asked him how he had returned so soon, and when she
heard how he had brought home the thirteen eyes, and given
them to the seven blind Queens, she could hardly restrain
her rage. Nevertheless she pretended to be charmed with
his success, and told him that if he would give her this pigeon
<span class="left"><a name="page441" id="page441"></a>[page&nbsp;441]</span>
also, she would reward him with the Jogi's wonderful cow,
whose milk flows all day long, and makes a pond as big as
a kingdom. The lad, nothing loth, gave her the pigeon;
whereupon, as before, she bade him go and ask her mother for
the cow, and gave him a potsherd where on was written, "Kill
this lad without fail, and sprinkle his blood like water!"</p>

<p>But on the way the son of seven Queens looked in on the
Princess, just to tell her how he came to be delayed, and she,
after reading the message on the potsherd, gave him another
in its stead; so that when the lad reached the old hag's hut
and asked her for the Jogi's cow, she could not refuse, but
told the boy how to find it; and bidding him of all things not
to be afraid of the eighteen thousand demons who kept watch
and ward over the treasure, told him to be off before she became
too angry at her daughter's foolishness in thus giving
away so many good things.</p>

<p>Then the lad bravely did as he had been told. He journeyed
on and on till he came to a milk-white pond, guarded
by the eighteen thousand demons. They were really frightful
to behold, but, plucking up courage, he whistled a tune
as he walked through them, looking neither to the right nor
the left. By and by he came upon the Jogi's cow, tall, white,
and beautiful, while the Jogi himself, who was king of all the
demons, sat milking her day and night, and the milk streamed
from her udder, filling the milk-white tank.</p>

<p>The Jogi, seeing the lad, called out fiercely, "What do
you want here?"</p>

<p>Then the lad answered, according to the old hag's bidding,
"I want your skin, for King Indra is making a new kettledrum,
and says your skin is nice and tough."</p>

<p>Upon this the Jogi began to shiver and shake (for no Jinn
or Jogi dares disobey King Indra's command), and, falling at
the lad's feet, cried, "If you will spare me I will give you
anything I possess, even my beautiful white cow!"</p>

<p>To this the son of seven Queens, after a little pretended
hesitation, agreed, saying that after all it would not be difficult
to find a nice tough skin like the Jogi's elsewhere; so
driving the wonderful cow before him, he set off homeward.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page442" id="page442"></a>[page&nbsp;442]</span>

<p>The seven Queens were delighted to possess so marvelous an
animal, and though they toiled from morning till night making
curds and whey, besides selling milk to the confectioners, they
could not use half the cow gave, and became richer and richer
day by day.</p>

<p>Seeing them so comfortably off, the son of seven Queens
started with a light heart to marry the Princess; but when
passing the white hind's palace he could not resist sending a
bolt at some pigeons that were cooing on the parapet. One
fell dead just beneath the window where the white Queen was sitting.
Looking out, she saw the lad, hale and hearty, standing
before her, and grew whiter than ever with rage and spite.</p>

<p>She sent for him to ask how he had returned so soon, and
when she heard how kindly her mother had received him, she
very nearly had a fit. However, she dissembled her feelings
as well as she could, and, smiling sweetly, said she was glad
to have been able to fulfil her promise, and that if he would
give her this third pigeon, she would do yet more for him than
she had done before, by giving him the millionfold rice, which
ripens in one night.</p>

<p>The lad was of course delighted at the very idea, and, giving
up the pigeon, set off on his quest, armed as before with
a potsherd, on which was written, "Do not fail this time. Kill
the lad, and sprinkle his blood like water!"</p>

<p>But when he looked in on his Princess, just to prevent her
becoming anxious about him, she asked to see the potsherd as
usual, and substituted another, on which was written, "Yet
again give this lad all he requires, for his blood shall be as
your blood!"</p>

<p>Now when the old hag saw this, and heard how the lad
wanted the millionfold rice which ripens in a single night, she
fell into the most furious rage, but being terribly afraid of her
daughter, she controlled herself, and bade the boy go and
find the field guarded by eighteen millions of demons, warning
him on no account to look back after having plucked the tallest
spike of rice, which grew in the center.</p>

<p>So the son of seven Queens set off, and soon came to the
field where, guarded by eighteen millions of demons, the millionfold
<span class="left"><a name="page443" id="page443"></a>[page&nbsp;443]</span>
rice grew. He walked on bravely, looking neither to
the right nor left, till he reached the center and plucked the
tallest ear, but as he turned homeward a thousand sweet voices
rose behind him, crying in tenderest accents, "Pluck me too!
oh, please pluck me too!" He looked back, and lo! there was
nothing left of him but a little heap of ashes!</p>

<p>Now as time passed by and the lad did not return, the old
hag grew uneasy, remembering the message "His blood shall
be as your blood"; so she set off to see what had happened.</p>

<p>Soon she came to the heap of ashes, and knowing by her
arts what it was, she took a little water, and kneading the ashes
into a paste, formed it into the likeness of a man; then, putting
a drop of blood from her little finger into its mouth, she blew
on it, and instantly the son of seven Queens started up as well
as ever.</p>

<p>"Don't you disobey orders again!" grumbled the old hag,
"or next time I'll leave you alone. Now be off, before I repent
of my kindness!"</p>

<p>So the son of seven Queens returned joyfully to his seven
mothers, who, by the aid of the millionfold rice, soon became
the richest people in the kingdom. Then they celebrated their
son's marriage to the clever Princess with all imaginable pomp;
but the bride was so clever, she would not rest until she had
made known her husband to his father, and punished the
wicked white witch. So she made her husband build a palace
exactly like the one in which the seven Queens had lived, and
in which the white witch now dwelt in splendor. Then, when
all was prepared, she bade her husband give a grand feast to
the King. Now the King had heard much of the mysterious
son of seven queens, and his marvelous wealth, so he gladly
accepted the invitation; but what was his astonishment when
on entering the palace he found it was a facsimile of his own
in every particular! And when his host, richly attired, led
him straight to the private hall, where on royal thrones sat the
seven Queens, dressed as he had last seen them, he was speechless
with surprise, until the Princess, coming forward, threw
herself at his feet and told him the whole story. Then the
King awoke from his enchantment, and his anger rose against
<span class="left"><a name="page444" id="page444"></a>[page&nbsp;444]</span>
the wicked white hind who had bewitched him so long, until
he could not contain himself. So she was put to death, and her
grave plowed over, and after that the seven Queens returned
to their own splendid palace, and everybody lived happily.</p>

<h2>WHO KILLED THE OTTER'S BABIES</h2>

<h4>ADAPTED BY WALTER SKEAT</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HE</b> Otter said to the Mouse-deer, "Friend Mouse-deer,
will you be so good as to take charge of the children till I
come back? I am going down to the river to catch fish, and when
I come back, I'll share the catch with you." The Mouse-deer
replied, "Very well! go along, and I'll look after the
children." So the Otter went down to the river to catch fish.</p>

<p>(Here the story of What the Otter Did stops and the story
of What Happened when the Woodpecker Sounded the War-gong
commences.) The Mouse-deer was Chief Dancer of
the War-dance, and as he danced he trod on the Otter's babies
and crushed them flat. Presently the Otter returned home,
bringing a string of fish with him. Oh arriving he saw that
his children had been killed, and exclaimed, "How comes it,
Friend Mouse-deer, that my babies have died?" The Mouse-deer
replied: "The Woodpecker came and sounded the war-gong,
and I, being Chief War-Dancer, danced; and, forgetting
about your children, I trod upon them and crushed them flat."</p>

<p>On hearing this the Otter went and made complaint unto
King Solomon, prostrating himself and saying: "Your Majesty's
most humble slave craves pardon for presuming to address
your Majesty, but Friend Mouse-deer has murdered your
slave's children, and your slave desires to learn whether he is
guilty or not according to the Law of the Land." King Solomon
replied, saying, "If the Mouse-deer hath done this thing wittingly,
assuredly he is guilty of death." Then he summoned the
Mouse-deer before him.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page445" id="page445"></a>[page&nbsp;445]</span>
<p>
And when the Mouse-deer came into the presence of the
King, the King inquired of the Otter, "What is your charge
against him?" The Otter replied, "Your slave accuses him
of the murder of your slave's children; your slave would hear
the Law of the Land." Then the King said unto the Mouse-deer,
"Was it your doing that the Otter's children were killed?"
The Mouse-deer replied, "Assuredly it was, but I crave pardon
for doing so." "How was it, then," said the King, "that you
came to kill them?" The Mouse-deer replied, "Your slave
came to kill them because the Woodpecker appeared and
sounded the War-gong. Your slave, as your Majesty is aware,
is Chief Dancer of the War-dance; therefore your slave danced,
and, forgetting about the Otter's children, your slave trod upon
them and crushed them flat." Here the King sent for the
Woodpecker also, and the Woodpecker came before him.
"Was it you, Woodpecker," said the King, "who sounded the
war-gong?" "Assuredly it was," said the Woodpecker,&mdash;"forasmuch
as your slave saw the Great Lizard wearing his
sword." The King replied, "If that is the case, there is no
fault to be found in the Woodpecker" (for the Woodpecker
was Chief Beater of the War-gong). Then the King commanded
the Great Lizard to be summoned, and when he arrived, the
King inquired, "Was it you, Lizard, wearing your sword?"
The Great Lizard replied, "Assuredly it was, your Majesty."
"And why were you wearing your sword?" The Great Lizard
replied, "Your slave wore it forasmuch as your slave saw that
the Tortoise had donned his coat of mail." So the Tortoise
was summoned likewise. "Why did you, Tortoise, don your
coat of mail?" The Tortoise replied, "Your slave donned it
forasmuch as your slave saw the King-crab trailing his three-edged
pike." Then the King-crab was sent for. "Why
were you, King-crab, trailing your three-edged pike?" "Because
your slave saw that the Crayfish had shouldered his
lance." Then the King sent for the Crayfish, and said, "Was
it you, Crayfish, who was shouldering your lance?" And the
Crayfish replied, "Assuredly it was, your Majesty." "And
why did you shoulder it?" "Because your slave saw the Otter
coming down to devour your slave's own children." "Oh,"
<span class="left"><a name="page446" id="page446"></a>[page&nbsp;446]</span>
said King Solomon, "if that is the case, you, Otter are the guilty
party, and your complaint of your children's death cannot be
sustained against the Mouse-deer by the Law of the Land."</p>

<h2>THE ALLIGATOR AND THE JACKAL</h2>

<h4>ADAPTED BY M. FRERE</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">A</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>HUNGRY</b> Jackal once went down to the riverside in search
of little crabs, bits of fish, and whatever else he could find
for his dinner. Now it chanced that in this river there lived a
great big Alligator, who, being also very hungry, would have
been extremely glad to eat the Jackal.</p>

<p>The Jackal ran up and down, here and there, but for a long
time could find nothing to eat. At last, close to where the
Alligator was lying among some tall bulrushes under the clear,
shallow water, he saw a little crab sidling along as fast as
his legs could carry him. The Jackal was so hungry that
when he saw this he poked his paw into the water to try to
catch the crab, when snap! the old Alligator caught hold of
him. "Oh, dear!" thought the Jackal to himself, "what
can I do? This great, big Alligator has caught my paw in
his mouth, and in another minute he will drag me down by
it under the water and kill me. My only chance is to make
him think he has made a mistake." So he called out in a
cheerful voice: "Clever Alligator, clever Alligator, to catch
hold of a bulrush root instead of my paw! I hope you find
it very tender." The Alligator, who was so buried among the
bulrushes that he could hardly see, thought, on hearing this:
"Dear me, how tiresome! I fancied I had caught hold of
the Jackal's paw; but there he is, calling out in a cheerful
voice. I suppose I must have seized a bulrush root instead,
as he says," and he let the Jackal go.</p>

<p>The Jackal ran away as fast as he could, crying, "O
wise Alligator, wise Alligator! So you let me go again!"</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page447" id="page447"></a>[page&nbsp;447]</span>

<p>Then the Alligator was very much vexed, but the Jackal had
run away too far to be caught. Next day the Jackal returned
to the riverside to get his dinner as before; but because he was
very much afraid of the Alligator he called out: "Whenever
I go to look for my dinner, I see the nice little crabs peeping up
through the mud; then I catch them and eat them. I wish I
could see one now."</p>

<p>The Alligator, who was buried in the mud at the bottom
of the river, heard every word. So he popped the little point
of his snout above it, thinking: "If I do but just show the tip of
my nose, the Jackal will take me for a crab and put in his paw
to catch me, and as soon as ever he does I'll gobble him up."</p>

<p>But no sooner did the Jackal see the little tip of the Alligator's
nose than he called out, "Aha, my friend! there you
are. No dinner for me in this part of the river, then, I think."
And so saying, he ran farther on and fished for his dinner
a long way from that place. The Alligator was very angry
at missing his prey a second time, and determined not to let
him escape again.</p>

<p>So on the following day, when his little tormentor returned
to the waterside, the Alligator hid himself close to the bank,
in order to catch him if he could. Now the Jackal was rather
afraid of going near the river, for he thought, "Perhaps the
Alligator will catch me to-day." But yet, being hungry, he
did not wish to go without his dinner; so to make all as safe
as he could, he cried: "Where are all the little crabs gone?
There is not one here and I am so hungry; and generally, even
when they are under water, one can see them going bubble,
bubble, bubble, and all the little bubbles go pop! pop! pop!"
On hearing this the Alligator, who was buried in the mud under
the river bank, thought: "I will pretend to be a little crab."
And he began to blow, "Puff, puff, puff! Bubble, bubble,
bubble!" and all the great bubbles rushed to the surface of
the river and burst there, and the waters eddied round and
round like a whirlpool; and there was such a commotion when
the huge monster began to blow bubbles in this way that the
Jackal saw very well who must be there, and he ran away
as fast as he could, saying, "Thank you, kind Alligator, thank
<span class="left"><a name="page448" id="page448"></a>[page&nbsp;448]</span>
you; thank you! Indeed, I would not have come here had I
known you were so close."</p>

<p>This enraged the Alligator extremely; it made him quite
cross to think of being so often deceived by a little Jackal, and
he said to himself, "I will be taken in no more. Next time
I will be very cunning." So for a long time he waited and
waited for the Jackal to return to the riverside; but the Jackal
did not come, for he had thought to himself: "If matters go on
in this way, I shall some day be caught and eaten by the wicked
old Alligator. I had better content myself with living on
wild figs," and he went no more near the river, but stayed
in the jungles and ate wild figs, and roots which he dug up with
his paws.</p>

<p>When the Alligator found this out, he determined to try
and catch the Jackal on land; so, going under the largest of the
wild fig-trees, where the ground was covered with the fallen
fruit, he collected a quantity of it together, and, burying himself
under the great heap, waited for the Jackal to appear.
But no sooner did the cunning little animal see this great
heap of wild figs all collected together than he thought, "That
looks very like my friend the Alligator." And to discover if
it were so or not, he called out: "The juicy little wild figs I
love to eat always tumble down from the tree, and roll here and
there as the wind drives them; but this great heap of figs is
quite still; these cannot be good figs; I will not eat any of them."
"Ho, ho!" thought the Alligator, "is that all? How suspicious
this Jackal is! I will make the figs roll about a
little, then, and when he sees that, he will doubtless come and
eat them."</p>

<p>So the great beast shook himself, and all the heap of little
figs went roll, roll, roll&mdash;some a mile this way, some a mile
that, farther than they had ever rolled before or than the most
blustering wind could have driven them.</p>

<p>Seeing this, the Jackal scampered away, saying: "I am
so much obliged to you, Alligator, for letting me know
you are there, for indeed I should hardly have guessed
it. You were so buried under that heap of figs." The Alligator,
hearing this, was so angry that he ran after the Jackal,
<span class="left"><a name="page449" id="page449"></a>[page&nbsp;449]</span>
but the latter ran very, very fast away, too quickly to be
caught.</p>

<p>Then the Alligator said to himself: "I will not allow that
little wretch to make fun of me another time and then run
away out of reach; I will show him that I can be more cunning
than he fancies." And early the next morning he crawled
as fast as he could to the Jackal's den (which was a hole in the
side of a hill) and crept into it, and hid himself, waiting for the
Jackal, who was out, to return home. But when the Jackal
got near the place, he looked about him and thought: "Dear
me! the ground looks as if some heavy creature had been
walking over it, and here are great clods of earth knocked
down from each side of the door of my den, as if a very big
animal had been trying to squeeze himself through it. I
certainly will not go inside until I know that all is safe there."
So he called out: "Little house, pretty house, my sweet little
house, why do you not give an answer when I call? If I come,
and all is safe and right, you always call out to me. Is anything
wrong, that you do not speak?"</p>

<p>Then the Alligator, who was inside, thought, "If that is
the case I had better call out, that he may fancy all is right
in his house." And in as gentle a voice as he could, he said,
"Sweet little Jackal."</p>

<p>At hearing these words the Jackal felt quite frightened, and
thought to himself: "So the dreadful old Alligator is there.
I must try to kill him if I can, for if I do not he will certainly
catch and kill me some day." He therefore answered: "Thank
you, my dear little house. I like to hear your pretty voice.
I am coming in in a minute, but first I must collect firewood
to cook my dinner." And he ran as fast as he could, and
dragged all the dry branches and bits of stick he could find
close up to the mouth of the den. Meantime, the Alligator
inside kept as quiet as a mouse, but he could not help laughing
a little to himself as he thought: "So I have deceived this
tiresome little Jackal at last. In a few minutes he will run in
here, and then won't I snap him up!"</p>

<p>When the Jackal had gathered together all the sticks he
could find and put them round the mouth of his den, he set
<span class="left"><a name="page450" id="page450"></a>[page&nbsp;450]</span>
them on fire and pushed them as far into it as possible. There
was such a quantity of them that they soon blazed up into a
great fire, and the smoke and flames filled the den and smothered
the wicked old Alligator and burned him to death, while
the little Jackal ran up and down outside dancing for joy and
singing:</p>

<p>"How do you like my house, my friend? Is it nice and
warm? Ding-dong! ding-dong! The Alligator is dying! ding-dong,
ding-dong! He will trouble me no more. I have defeated
my enemy! Ring-a-ting! ding-a-ting! ding-ding-dong!"</p>

<h2>THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HERE</b> was once a Farmer who suffered much at the hands
of a Money-lender. Good harvests or bad the Farmer was
always poor, the Money-lender rich. At the last, when he
hadn't a farthing left, the Farmer went to the Money-lender's
house and said, "You can't squeeze water from a stone, and,
as you have nothing to get by me now, you might tell me the
secret of becoming rich."</p>

<p>"My friend," returned the Money-lender piously, "riches
come from Ram&mdash;ask <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I will!" replied the simple Farmer; so he prepared
three girdle-cakes to last him on the journey, and set
out to find Ram.</p>

<p>First he met a Brahman, and to him he gave a cake, asking
him to point out the road to Ram; but the Brahman only took
the cake, and went on his way without a word. Next the
Farmer met a yogi, or devotee, and to him he gave a cake,
without receiving any help in return. At last he came upon
a poor man sitting under a tree, and finding out he was hungry
the kindly Farmer gave him his last cake, and, sitting down
to rest beside him, entered into conversation.</p>

<p>"And where are you going?" asked the poor man, at length.</p>

<p>"Oh, I have a long journey before me, for I am going to
<span class="left"><a name="page451" id="page451"></a>[page&nbsp;451]</span>
find Ram!" replied the Farmer. "I don't suppose you could
tell me which way to go?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can," said the poor man, smiling, "for <i>I</i> am
Ram! What do you want of me?"</p>

<p>Then the Farmer told the whole story, and Ram, taking
pity on him, gave him a conch-shell, and showed him how to
blow it in a particular way, saying: "Remember! whatever
you wish for, you have only to blow the conch that way, and
your wish will be fulfilled. Only, have a care of that Money-lender,
for even magic is not proof against his wiles!"</p>

<p>The Farmer went back to his village rejoicing. In fact, the
Money-lender noticed his high spirits at once, and said to himself,
"Some good fortune must have befallen the stupid fellow,
to make him hold his head so jauntily." Therefore he
went over to the simple Farmer's house, and congratulated
him on his good fortune in such cunning words, pretending
to have heard all about it, that before long the Farmer found
himself telling the whole story&mdash;all except the secret of blowing
the conch, for, with all his simplicity, the Farmer was not
quite such a fool as to tell that.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Money-lender determined to have the
conch by hook or by crook, and, as he was villain enough not
to stick at trifles, he waited for a favorable opportunity and
stole the conch.</p>

<p>But, after nearly bursting himself with blowing the conch
in every conceivable way, he was obliged to give up the secret
as a bad job. However, being determined to succeed, he went
back to the Farmer, and said coolly: "Look here! I've got
your conch, but I can't use it; you haven't got it, so it's clear
you can't use it either. Business is at a standstill unless we
make a bargain. Now, I promise to give you back your conch,
and never to interfere with your using it, on one condition,
which is this&mdash;whatever you get from it, I am to get double."</p>

<p>"Never!" cried the Farmer; "that would be the old business
all over again!"</p>

<p>"Not at all!" replied the wily Money-lender; "you will have
your share! Now, don't be a dog in the manger, for, if <i>you</i> get
all you want, what can it matter to you if <i>I</i> am rich or poor?"</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page452" id="page452"></a>[page&nbsp;452]</span>

<p>At last, though it went sorely against the grain to be of
any benefit to a Money-lender, the Farmer was forced to yield,
and from that time, no matter what he gained by the power
of the conch, the Money-lender gained double. And the
knowledge that this was so, preyed upon the Farmer's mind
day and night, so that he had no satisfaction out of anything.</p>

<p>At last there came a very dry season&mdash;so dry that the
Farmer's crops withered for want of rain. Then he blew his
conch, and wished for a well to water them, and lo! there was
the well, <i>but the Money-lender had two!</i>&mdash;two beautiful new
wells! This was too much for any Farmer to stand; and our
friend brooded over it, and brooded over it, till at last a bright
idea came into his head. He seized the conch, blew it loudly,
and cried out, "Oh, Ram! I wish to be blind of one eye!"
And so he was, in a twinkling, but the Money-lender, of course,
was blind of both, and in trying to steer his way between the
two new wells he fell into one, and was drowned.</p>

<p>Now, this true story shows that a Farmer once got the
better of a Money-lender&mdash;but only by losing one of his eyes.</p>

<h2>TIT FOR TAT</h2>

<h4>ADAPTED BY M. FRERE</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HERE</b> once lived a Camel and a Jackal who were great
friends. One day the Jackal said to the Camel, "I know
that there is a fine field of sugarcane on the other side of the
river. If you will take me across, I'll show you the place.
This plan will suit me as well as you. You will enjoy eating
the sugarcane, and I am sure to find many crabs' bones and
bits of fish by the riverside, on which to make a good dinner."</p>

<p>The Camel consented, and swam across the river, taking
the Jackal, who could not swim, on his back. When they
reached the other side, the Camel went to eating the sugarcane,
<span class="left"><a name="page453" id="page453"></a>[page&nbsp;453]</span>
and the Jackal ran up and down the river bank, devouring all
the crabs, bits of fish, and bones he could find.</p>

<p>But being a much smaller animal, he had made an excellent
meal before the Camel had eaten more than two or
three mouthfuls; and no sooner had he finished his dinner than
he ran round and round the sugarcane field, yelping and howling
with all his might.</p>

<p>The villagers heard him, and thought, "There is a jackal
among the sugarcanes; he will be scratching holes in the ground
and spoiling the roots of the plants." And they all went down
to the place to drive him away. But when they got there they
found to their surprise not only a Jackal, but a Camel who was
eating the sugarcanes! This made them very angry, and
they caught the poor Camel and drove him from the field
and beat him and beat him until he was nearly dead.</p>

<p>When they had gone, the Jackal said to the Camel, "We
had better go home." And the Camel said, "Very well; then
jump upon my back, as you did before."</p>

<p>So the Jackal jumped upon the Camel's back, and the
Camel began to recross the river. When they had got well
into the water, the Camel said: "This is a pretty way in which
you have treated me, friend Jackal. No sooner had you
finished your own dinner than you must go yelping about the
place loud enough to arouse the whole village, and bring all the
villagers down to beat me black and blue, and turn me out of
the field before I had eaten two mouthfuls! What in the world
did you make such a noise for?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the Jackal. "It is a custom I have.
I always like to sing a little after dinner."</p>

<p>The Camel waded on through the river. The water reached
up to his knees&mdash;then above them&mdash;up, up, up, higher and
higher, until he was obliged to swim. Then turning to the
Jackal, he said, "I feel very anxious to roll." "Oh, pray
don't; why do you wish to do so?" asked the Jackal. "I
don't know," answered the Camel. "It is a custom I have.
I always like to have a little roll after dinner." So saying, he
rolled over in the water, shaking the Jackal off as he did so.
And the Jackal was drowned, but the Camel swam safely ashore.</p>

<h2>SINGH RAJAH AND THE CUNNING LITTLE JACKALS</h2>

<h4>ADAPTED BY M. FRERE</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> upon a time, in a great jungle, there lived a great
lion. He was rajah of all the country round, and every day
he used to leave his den, in the deepest shadow of the rocks,
and roar with a loud, angry voice; and when he roared, the
other animals in the jungle, who were all his subjects, got very
much frightened and ran here and there; and Singh Rajah
would pounce upon them and kill them, and gobble them up
for his dinner.</p>

<p>This went on for a long, long time until, at last, there were
no living creatures left in the jungle but two little jackals&mdash;a
Rajah Jackal and a Ranee Jackal&mdash;husband and wife.</p>

<p>A very hard time of it the poor little jackals had, running
this way and that to escape the terrible Singh Rajah; and
every day the little Ranee Jackal would say to her husband:
"I am afraid he will catch us to-day; do you hear how he is
roaring? Oh, dear! oh, dear!" And he would answer her:
"Never fear; I will take care of you. Let us run on a mile
or two. Come; come quick, quick, quick!" And they would
both run away as fast as they could.</p>

<p>After some time spent in this way, they found, however,
one fine day, that the lion was so close upon them that they
could not escape. Then the little Ranee Jackal said: "Husband,
husband, I feel much frightened. The Singh Rajah
is so angry he will certainly kill us at once. What can we
do?" But he answered: "Cheer up; we can save ourselves
yet. Come, and I'll show you how we may manage it."</p>

<p>So what did these cunning little jackals do but they went
to the great lion's den; and, when he saw them coming, he
began to roar and shake his mane, and he said: "You little
wretches, come and be eaten at once! I have had no dinner
for three whole days, and all that time I have been running
over hill and dale to find you. Ro-a-ar! Ro-a-ar! Come
<span class="left"><a name="page455" id="page455"></a>[page&nbsp;455]</span>
and be eaten, I say!" and he lashed his tail and gnashed his
teeth, and looked very terrible indeed. Then the Jackal
Rajah, creeping quite close up to him, said: "Oh, great
Singh Rajah, we all know you are our master, and we would
have come at your bidding long ago; but, indeed, sir, there is a
much bigger rajah even than you in this jungle, and he tried to
catch hold of us and eat us up, and frightened us so much
that we were obliged to run away."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" growled Singh Rajah. "There is
no king in this jungle but me!" "Ah, sire," answered the
jackal, "in truth one would think so, for you are very dreadful.
Your very voice is death. But it is as we say, for we,
with our own eyes, have seen one with whom you could not
compete&mdash;whose equal you can no more be than we are yours&mdash;whose
face is as flaming fire, his step as thunder, and his
power supreme." "It is impossible!" interrupted the old
lion; "but show me this rajah of whom you speak so much,
that I may destroy him instantly!"</p>

<p>Then the little jackals ran on before him until they reached
a great well, and, pointing down to his own reflection in the
water, they said, "See, sire, there lives the terrible king of
whom we spoke." When Singh Rajah looked down the well
he became very angry, for he thought he saw another lion
there. He roared and shook his great mane, and the shadow
lion shook his and looked terribly defiant. At last, beside himself
with rage at the violence of his opponent, Singh Rajah
sprang down to kill him at once, but no other lion was there&mdash;only
the treacherous reflection&mdash;and the sides of the well
were so steep that he could not get out again to punish the
two jackals, who peeped over the top. After struggling for
some time in the deep water, he sank to rise no more. And
the little jackals threw stones down upon him from above, and
danced round and round the well, singing: "Ao! Ao! Ao! Ao!
The king of the forest is dead, is dead! We have killed the
great lion who would have killed us! Ao! Ao! Ao! Ao!
Ring-a-ting&mdash;ding-a-ting! Ring-a-ting&mdash;ding-a-ting! Ao! Ao! Ao!"</p>

<h1>AMERICAN INDIAN STORIES</h1>

<hr class="short" />


<h2>THE WHITE STONE CANOE</h2>

<h4>ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HERE</b> was once a very beautiful Indian maiden, who died
suddenly on the day she was to have been married to a
handsome young warrior. He was also brave, but his heart was
not proof against this loss. From the hour she was buried,
there was no more joy or peace for him.</p>

<p>He went often to visit the spot where the women had buried
her, and sat musing there, when, it was thought by some of
his friends, he would have done better to try to amuse himself
in the chase, or by diverting his thoughts in the warpath. But
war and hunting had both lost their charms for him. His
heart was already dead within him. He pushed aside both
his war-club and his bow and arrows.</p>

<p>He had heard the old people say, that there was a path
that led to the land of souls, and he determined to follow it. He
accordingly set out, one morning, after having completed his
preparations for the journey. At first he hardly knew which
way to go. He was only guided by the tradition that he must
go south. For a while he could see no change in the face of
the country. Forests, and hills, and valleys, and streams had
the same looks which they wore in his native place.</p>

<p>There was snow on the ground when he set out, and it was
sometimes seen to be piled and matted on the thick trees and
bushes. At length it began to diminish, and finally disappeared.
The forest assumed a more cheerful appearance, the leaves
put forth their buds, and before he was aware of the completeness
of the change, he found himself surrounded by
spring.</p>

<p>He had left behind him the land of snow and ice. The air
<span class="left"><a name="page457" id="page457"></a>[page&nbsp;457]</span>
became mild, the dark clouds of winter had rolled away from
the sky; a pure field of blue was above him, and as he went he
saw flowers beside his path, and heard the songs of birds. By
these signs he knew that he was going the right way, for they
agreed with the traditions of his tribe. At length he spied a
path. It led him through a grove, then up a long and elevated
ridge, on the very top of which he came to a lodge. At the
door stood an old man, with white hair, whose eyes, though
deeply sunk, had a fiery brilliancy. He had a long robe of skins
thrown loosely around his shoulders, and a staff in his hands.</p>

<p>The young Chippewayan began to tell his story; but the
venerable chief arrested him before he had proceeded to speak
ten words. "I have expected you," he replied, "and had
just risen to bid you welcome to my abode. She whom you
seek passed here but a few days since, and being fatigued with
her journey, rested herself here. Enter my lodge and be
seated, and I will then satisfy your inquiries, and give you
directions for your journey from this point." Having done
this, they both issued forth to the lodge door.</p>

<p>"You see yonder gulf," said he, "and the wide-stretching
blue plains beyond. It is the land of souls. You stand upon
its borders, and my lodge is the gate of entrance. But you can
not take your body along. Leave it here with your bow and
arrows, your bundle, and your dog. You will find them safe
on your return." So saying, he re-entered the lodge, and the
freed traveler bounded forward as if his feet had suddenly
been endowed with the power of wings.</p>

<p>But all things retained their natural colors and shapes.
The woods and leaves, and streams and lakes, were only more
bright and comely than he had ever witnessed. Animals
bounded across his path, with a freedom and a confidence which
seemed to tell him there was no blood shed here. Birds of
beautiful plumage inhabited the groves, and sported in the
waters. There was but one thing in which he saw a very unusual
effect. He noticed that his passage was not stopped by
trees or other objects. He appeared to walk directly through
them. They were, in fact, but the souls or shadows of material
trees. He became sensible that he was in a land of shadows.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page458" id="page458"></a>[page&nbsp;458]</span>

<p>When he had traveled half a day's journey, through a
country which was continually becoming more attractive, he
came to the banks of a broad lake, in the center of which was
a large and beautiful island. He found a canoe of shining
white stone, tied to the shore. He was now sure that he had
taken the right path, for the aged man had told him this. There
were also shining paddles. He immediately entered the canoe,
and took the paddles in his hands, when, to his joy and surprise,
on turning round he beheld the object of his search in
another canoe, exactly its counterpart in everything. She had
exactly imitated his motions, and they were side by side.</p>

<p>They at once pushed out from shore and began to cross
the lake. Its waves seemed to be rising, and at a distance
looked ready to swallow them up; but just as they entered
the whitened edge of them they seemed to melt away, as
if they were but the images of waves. But no sooner was one
wreath of foam passed, than another, more threatening still,
arose.</p>

<p>Thus they were in perpetual fear; and what added to it,
was the <i>clearness of the water</i>, through which they could see
heaps of beings who had perished before, and whose bones
lay strewed on the bottom of the lake. The Master of Life
had, however, decreed to let them pass, for the actions of neither
of them had been bad. But they saw many others struggling
and sinking in the waves. Old and young of all ages and
ranks, were there: some passed and some sank. It was
only the little children whose canoes seemed to meet no
waves.</p>

<p>At length every difficulty was gone, as in a moment, and
they both leaped out on the happy island. They felt that the
very air was food. It strengthened and nourished them.
They wandered together over the blissful fields, where every
thing was formed to please the eye and the ear. There were no
tempests&mdash;there was no ice, no chilly winds&mdash;no one shivered
for the want of warm clothes: no one suffered hunger&mdash;no
one mourned for the dead. They saw no graves. They heard
of no wars. There was no hunting of animals; for the air itself
was their food. Gladly would the young warrior have remained
<span class="left"><a name="page459" id="page459"></a>[page&nbsp;459]</span>
there forever, but he was obliged to go back for his body. He
did not see the Master of Life, but he heard his voice in a soft
breeze.</p>

<p>"Go back," said this voice, "to the land from whence you
came. Your time has not yet come. The duties for which I
made you, and which you are to perform, are not yet finished.
Return to your people, and accomplish the duties of a good man.
You will be the ruler of your tribe for many days. The rules
you must observe will be told you by my messenger, who keeps
the gate. When he surrenders back your body, he will tell you
what to do. Listen to him and you shall afterward rejoin the
spirit, which you must now leave behind. She is accepted and
will be ever here, as young and as happy as she was when I first
called her from the land of snows." When this voice ceased,
the narrator awoke. It was all the fabric of a dream, and
he was still in the bitter land of snows, and hunger, and tears.</p>

<h2>THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HERE</b> was once among the Marshpees, a small tribe who
have their hunting-grounds on the shores of the Great
Lake, near the Cape of Storms, a woman whose name was
Awashanks. She was rather silly and very idle. For days together
she would sit doing nothing. Then she was so ugly
and ill-shaped that not one of the youths of the village would
have aught to say to her by way of courtship or marriage.
She squinted very much; her face was long and thin, her nose
excessively large and humped, her teeth crooked and projecting,
her chin almost as sharp as the bill of a loon, and her ears as
large as those of a deer. Altogether she was a very odd and
strangely formed woman, and wherever she went she never
failed to excite much laughter and derision among those who
thought that ugliness and deformity were fit subjects for
ridicule.</p>

<p>Though so very ugly, there was one faculty she possessed
<span class="left"><a name="page460" id="page460"></a>[page&nbsp;460]</span>
in a more remarkable degree than any woman of the tribe.
It was that of singing. Nothing, unless such could be found
in the land of spirits, could equal the sweetness of her voice
or the beauty of her songs. Her favorite place of resort was
a small hill, a little removed from the river of her people, and
there, seated beneath the shady trees, she would while away
the hours of summer with her charming songs. So beautiful
and melodious were the things she uttered that, by the time
she had sung a single sentence, the branches above her head
would be filled with the birds that came thither to listen, the
thickets around her would be crowded with beasts, and the
waters rolling beside her would be alive with fishes, all attracted
by the sweet sounds. From the minnow to the porpoise,
from the wren to the eagle, from the snail to the lobster,
from the mouse to the mole&mdash;all hastened to the spot to
listen to the charming songs of the hideous Marshpee
maiden.</p>

<p>Among the fishes which repaired every night to the vicinity
of the Little Hillock, which was the chosen resting-place of
the ugly songstress, was the great chief of the trouts, a tribe
of fish inhabiting the river near by. The chief was of a far
greater size than the people of his nation usually are, being
as long as a man and quite as broad.</p>

<p>Of all the creatures which came to listen to the singing of
Awashanks none appeared to enjoy it so highly as the chief of
the trouts. As his bulk prevented him from approaching so
near as he wished, he, from time to time, in his eagerness to enjoy
the music to the best advantage, ran his nose into the ground,
and thus worked his way a considerable distance into the land.
Nightly he continued his exertions to approach the source of
the delightful sounds he heard, till at length he had plowed
out a wide and handsome channel, and so effected his passage
from the river to the hill, a distance extending an arrow's-flight.
Thither he repaired every night at the commencement of darkness,
sure to meet the maiden who had become so necessary
to his happiness. Soon he began to speak of the pleasure he
enjoyed, and to fill the ears of Awashanks with fond protestations
of his love and affection. Instead of singing to him, she
<span class="left"><a name="page461" id="page461"></a>[page&nbsp;461]</span>
now began to listen to his voice. It was something so new
and strange to her to hear the tones of love and courtship,
a thing so unusual to be told she was beautiful, that it is
not wonderful her head was turned by the new incident,
and that she began to think the voice of her lover the sweetest
she had ever heard. One thing marred their happiness.
This was that the trout could not live upon land, nor the
maiden in the water. This state of things gave them much
sorrow.</p>

<p>They had met one evening at the usual place, and were discoursing
together, lamenting that two who loved each other
so, should be doomed always to live apart, when a man appeared
close to Awashanks. He asked the lovers why they
seemed to be so sad.</p>

<p>The chief of the trouts told the stranger the cause of their
sorrow.</p>

<p>"Be not grieved nor hopeless," said the stranger, when the
chief had finished. "The impediments can be removed. I
am the spirit who presides over fishes, and though I cannot
make a man or woman of a fish, I can make them into
fish. Under my power Awashanks shall become a beautiful
trout."</p>

<p>With that he bade the girl follow him into the river. When
they had waded in some little depth he took up some water
in his hand and poured it on her head, muttering some words,
of which none but himself knew the meaning. Immediately a
change took place in her. Her body took the form of a fish,
and in a few moments she was a complete trout. Having
accomplished this transformation the spirit gave her to the
chief of the trouts, and the pair glided off into the deep and
quiet waters. She did not, however, forget the land of her
birth. Every season, on the same night as that upon which
her disappearance from her tribe had been wrought, there
were to be seen two trouts of enormous size playing in the
water off the shore. They continued their visits till the palefaces
came to the country, when, deeming themselves to be in
danger from a people who paid no reverence to the spirits of
the land, they bade it adieu forever.</p>

<h2>THE STAR WIFE</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">I</span></p>
<p><b>N</b> the days when the buffalo raced and thundered over
the earth and the stars danced and sang in the sky, a brave
young hunter lived on the bank of Battle River. He was fond
of the red flowers and the blue sky; and when the rest of the
Indians went out to hunt in waistcloths of skin he put on his
fringed leggings all heavy with blue beads, and painted red
rings and stripes on his face, till he was as gay as the earth and
the sky himself. High-feather was his name, and he always
wore a red swan's feather on his head.</p>

<p>One day, when High-feather was out with his bow and
arrows, he came on a little beaten trail that he had never seen
before, and he followed it&mdash;but he found that it went round and
round and brought him back to where he had started. It
came from nowhere, and it went to nowhere.</p>

<p>"What sort of animal has made this?" he said. And
he lay down in the middle of the ring to think, looking up into
the blue sky.</p>

<p>While he lay thinking, he saw a little speck up above him
in the sky, and thought it was an eagle. But the speck grew
bigger, and sank down and down, till he saw it was a great
basket coming down out of the sky. He jumped up and ran
back to a little hollow and lay down to hide in a patch of tall
red flowers. Then he peeped out and saw the basket come down
to the earth and rest on the grass in the middle of the ring.
Twelve beautiful maidens were leaning over the edge of the
basket. They were not Indian maidens, for their faces were
pink and white, and their long hair was bright red-brown like a
fox's fur, and their clothes were sky-blue and floating light as
cobwebs.</p>

<p>The maidens jumped out of the basket and began to dance
round and round the ring-trail, one behind the other, drumming
with their fingers on little drums of eagle-skin, and singing
such beautiful songs as High-feather had never heard.</p>

<p>Then High-feather jumped up and ran towards the ring,
crying out, "Let me dance and sing with you!"</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page463" id="page463"></a>[page&nbsp;463]</span>

<p>The maidens were frightened, and ran to the basket and
jumped in, and the basket flew up into the sky, and grew
smaller till at last he could not see it at all.</p>

<p>The young man went home to his wigwam, and his mother
roasted buffalo meat for his dinner; but he could not eat, and
he could not think of anything but the twelve beautiful maidens.
His mother begged him to tell her what the matter was; and at
last he told her, and said he would never be happy till he brought
one of the maidens home to be his wife.</p>

<p>"Those must be the Star-people," said his mother, who was
a great magician&mdash;the prairie was full of magic in those days,
before the white man came and the buffalo went. "You had
better take an Indian girl for your wife. Don't think any more
of the Star-maidens, or you will have much trouble."</p>

<p>"I care little how much trouble I have, so long as I get a
Star-maiden for my wife," he said; "and I am going to get one,
if I have to wait till the world ends."</p>

<p>"If you must, you must," said his mother.</p>

<p>So next morning she sewed a bit of gopher's fur on to his
feather; and he ate a good breakfast of buffalo meat and tramped
away over the prairie to the dancing ring. As soon as he came
into the ring he turned into a gopher; but there were no gophers'
holes there for him to hide in, so he had to lie in the grass and
wait.</p>

<p>Presently he saw a speck up in the sky, and the speck grew
larger and larger till it became a basket, and the basket came
down and down till it rested on the earth in the middle of the ring.</p>

<p>The eldest maiden put her head over the edge and looked
all around, north and east and south and west.</p>

<p>"There is no man here," she said. So they all jumped
out to have their dance. But before they came to the beaten
ring the youngest maiden spied the gopher, and called out to
her sisters to look at it.</p>

<p>"Away! away!" cried the eldest maiden. "No gopher
would dare to come on our dancing ground. It is a conjuror
in disguise!"</p>

<p>So she took her youngest sister by the arm and pulled her
away to the basket, and they all jumped in and the basket went
<span class="left"><a name="page464" id="page464"></a>[page&nbsp;464]</span>
sailing up into the sky before High-feather could get out of
his gopher skin or say a word.</p>

<p>The young man went home very miserable; but when
his mother heard what had happened she said: "It is a hard
thing you want to do; but if you must, you must. To-night I
will make some fresh magic, and you can try again to-morrow."</p>

<p>Next morning High-feather asked for his breakfast; but
his mother said, "You must not have any buffalo meat, or it
will spoil the magic. You must not eat anything but the wild
strawberries you find on the prairie as you go."</p>

<p>Then she sewed a little bit of a mouse's whisker on to his
red feather; and he tramped away across the prairie, picking
wild strawberries and eating them as he went, till he came to
the dancing ring. As soon as he was inside the ring he turned
into a little mouse, and made friends with the family of mice
that lived in a hole under the grass; and the mother mouse
promised to help him all she could.</p>

<p>They had not waited long when the basket came dropping
down out of the sky. The eldest sister put her head over
the edge, and looked all around, north and west and south and
east and down on the ground.</p>

<p>"There is no man here," she said, "and I do not see any
gopher; but you must be very careful."</p>

<p>So they all got out of the basket, and began to dance round
the ring, drumming and singing as they went. But when they
came near the mouse's nest the eldest sister held up her hand,
and they stopped dancing and held their breath. Then she
tapped on the ground and listened.</p>

<p>"It does not sound so hollow as it did," she said, "The
mice have a visitor."</p>

<p>And she tapped again, and called out, "Come and show
yourselves, you little traitors, or we will dig you up!"</p>

<p>But the mother mouse had made another door to her nest,
just outside the ring, working very fast with all her toes; and
while the maidens were looking for her inside the ring she
came out at the other door with all her children and scampered
away across the prairie.</p>

<p>The maidens turned round and ran after them; all but
<span class="left"><a name="page465" id="page465"></a>[page&nbsp;465]</span>
the youngest sister, who did not want any one to be killed;
and High-feather came out of the hole and turned himself into
what he was, and caught her by the arm.</p>

<p>"Come home and marry me," he said, "and dance with
the Indian maidens; and I will hunt for you, and my mother
will cook for you, and you will be much happier than up in the
sky."</p>

<p>Her sisters came rushing round her, and begged her to go
back home to the sky with them; but she looked into the young
man's eyes, and said she would go with him wherever he went.
So the other maidens went weeping and wailing up into the
sky, and High-feather took his Star-wife home to his tent on the
bank of the Battle River.</p>

<p>High-feather's mother was glad to see them both; but she
whispered in his ear: "You must never let her out of your
sight if you want to keep her; you must take her with you
everywhere you go."</p>

<p>And he did so. He took her with him every time he went
hunting, and he made her a bow and arrows, but she would
never use them; she would pick wild strawberries and gooseberries
and raspberries as they went along, but she would never
kill anything; and she would never eat anything that any one
else had killed. She only ate berries and crushed corn.</p>

<p>One day, while the young man's wife was embroidering
feather stars on a dancing-cloth, and his mother was gossiping
in a tent at the end of the village, a little yellow bird flew in and
perched on High-feather's shoulder, and whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>"There is a great flock of wild red swans just over on Loon
Lake. If you come quickly and quietly you can catch them
before they fly away; but do not tell your wife, for red swans
cannot bear the sight of a woman, and they can tell if one comes
within a mile of them."</p>

<p>High-feather had never seen or heard of a red swan before;
all the red feathers he wore he had had to paint. He looked
at his wife, and as she was sewing busily and looking down at
her star embroidering he thought he could slip away and get
back before she knew he had gone. But as soon as he was out
of sight the little yellow bird flew in and perched on her shoulder,
<span class="left"><a name="page466" id="page466"></a>[page&nbsp;466]</span>
and sang her such a beautiful song about her sisters in the sky
that she forgot everything else and slipped out and ran like
the wind, and got to the dancing ring just as her sisters came
down in their basket. Then they all gathered round her, and
begged her to go home with them.</p>

<p>But she only said, "High-feather is a brave man, and
he is very good to me, and I will never leave him."</p>

<p>When they saw they could not make her leave her husband,
the eldest sister said: "If you must stay, you must.
But just come up for an hour, to let your father see you, because
he has been mourning for you ever since you went away."</p>

<p>The Star-wife did not wish to go, but she wanted to see her
father once more, so she got into the basket and it sailed away
up into the sky. Her father was very glad to see her, and she
was very glad to see him, and they talked and they talked till
the blue sky was getting gray. Then she remembered that she
ought to have gone home long before.</p>

<p>"Now I must go back to my husband," she said.</p>

<p>"That you shall never do!" said her father.</p>

<p>And he shut her up in a white cloud and said she should
stay there till she promised never to go back to the prairie.
She begged to be let out, but it was no use.</p>

<p>Then she began to weep; and she wept so much that the
cloud began to weep too, and it was weeping itself quite away.
So her father saw she would go down to the earth in rain if he
kept her in the cloud any longer, and he let her out.</p>

<p>"What must I do for you," he said, "to make you stay
with us here and be happy?"</p>

<p>"I will not stay here," she said, "unless my husband comes
and lives here too."</p>

<p>"I will send for him at once," said her father. So he sent
the basket down empty, and it rested in the middle of the
dancing ring.</p>

<p>Now when High-feather reached Loon Lake he found
it covered with red swans. He shot two with one arrow, and
then all the rest flew away. He picked up the two swans and
hurried back to his tent, and there lay the dancing-cloth with
the feather stars on it half finished, but no wife could he see.
<span class="left"><a name="page467" id="page467"></a>[page&nbsp;467]</span>
He called her, but she did not answer. He rushed out, with the
two red swans still slung round his neck and hanging down his
back, and ran to the dancing ring, but nobody was there.</p>

<p>"I will wait till she comes back," he said to himself, "if
I have to wait till the world ends." So he threw himself down
on the grass and lay looking up at the stars till he went to sleep.</p>

<p>Early in the morning he heard a rustling on the grass, and
when he opened his eyes he saw the great basket close beside
him. He jumped up, with the two red swans still slung round
his neck, and climbed into the basket. There was nobody
there; and when he began to climb out again he found that the
basket was half way up to the sky. It went up and up, and at
last it came into the Star-country, where his wife was waiting
for him. Her father gave them a beautiful blue tent to live in,
and High-feather was happy enough for a while; but he soon
grew tired of the cloud-berries that the Star-people ate, and
he longed to tramp over the solid green prairie, so he asked
his wife's father to let him take her back to the earth.</p>

<p>"No," said the Star-man, "because then I should never
see her again. If you stay with us you will soon forget the dull
old earth."</p>

<p>The young man said nothing; but he put on the wings
of one of the red swans, and he put the other red swan's wings
on his wife, and they leapt over the edge of the Star-country
and flew down through the air to the prairie, and came to the
tent where High-feather's mother was mourning for them;
and there was a great feast in the village because they had come
back safe and sound. The Star-wife finished embroidering
her dancing-cloth that day; and whenever the Indians danced
she danced with them. She never went back to the Star-maidens'
dancing ring; but she still lived on berries and corn,
because she would never kill anything,&mdash;except one thing,
and that was the little yellow bird. It flew into the tent one
day when High-feather had his back turned, and began to
whisper into the Star-wife's ear; but it never came to trouble
her again.</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">C</span></p>
<p><b>ALIPH</b> Charid, of Bagdad, was reclining on his
divan one pleasant afternoon, smoking his long pipe
and sipping coffee from a handsome dish which a slave was
holding for him, when his Grand Vizier, Mansor, entered and
told him of a peddler in the court below whose wares might
interest him. The Caliph, being in an affable state of mind,
summoned the peddler, who, delighted with the opportunity,
displayed all the treasures of his pack. There were pearls, rings,
silks, and many other rich things. The Caliph selected something
for himself, a handsome present for the Vizier, and another
for the Vizier's wife.</p>

<p>Just as the peddler was putting the things back into his
box, the Caliph noticed a small drawer and asked what it
contained.</p>

<p>"Only something of no value, which I picked up in a
street of Mecca," the peddler replied. He thereupon opened
the drawer and showed the Caliph a small box, containing a
black powder and a scroll written in characters which neither
the Caliph nor his Grand Vizier could make out. The Caliph
immediately decided that he wanted this strange scroll, and the
peddler was persuaded to part with it for a trifle. Then the
Vizier was asked to find some one to decipher its meaning.</p>

<p>Near the mosque lived a man called Selim, who was so
learned that he knew every language in the world. When the
Vizier brought him to interpret the scroll, the Caliph said to
him:</p>

<p>"They tell me that you are a scholar and can read all
languages. If you can decipher what is written here, I shall
<span class="left"><a name="page469" id="page469"></a>[page&nbsp;469]</span>
know that it is true, and will give you a robe of honor; but if
you fail, I shall have you punished with many strokes, because
you are falsely named."</p>

<p>Selim prostrated himself at the feet of the Caliph, and then
took the scroll. He had not looked at it long when he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"My lord and master, I hope to die if this is not Latin."</p>

<p>"Well, if so, let us hear what it says," the Caliph impatiently
answered. Selim at once began:</p>

<p>"Let him who finds this box praise Allah. If he snuffs the
powder it contains, at the same time pronouncing the word
'Matabor,' he will be transformed into any creature that he
desires, and will understand the language of all animals. When
he wishes to return to his own form, let him bow to the
east three times, repeating the word 'Matabor.' But remember
if, while he is bird or beast, he should laugh, the magic
word would be forgotten, and the enchantment would be on him
forever."</p>

<p>The Caliph was delighted with the knowledge of Selim. He
made him a splendid present, and told him to keep the secret.
When he had dismissed the learned man, he turned to the
Grand Vizier, and expressed a wish to try the powder.</p>

<p>"Come to-morrow morning early," said he, "and we will go
together to the country and learn what the animals are talking
about."</p>

<p>The Vizier came as he was ordered, and they left the palace
without attendants. Beyond the town was a large pond where
some handsome storks were often seen, and to this place they
presently came. A grave and stately stork was hunting for
frogs, while another flew about and kept him company.</p>

<p>"Most gracious lord," said the Vizier, "what think you of
these dignified long legs, and how would you like to know their
chatter?"</p>

<p>The Caliph replied that the stork had always interested him,
and he would very much like a more intimate acquaintance.
Taking the box from his girdle, he helped himself to a pinch of
snuff and offered it to the Vizier, who followed his example.</p>

<p>Together they cried "Matabor," and instantly their beards
disappeared, and feathers covered their bodies; their necks
<span class="left"><a name="page470" id="page470"></a>[page&nbsp;470]</span>
stretched out long and slender, and their legs shriveled into red
and shapeless sticks. The Caliph lifted up his foot to stroke his
beard in astonishment, but found a long bill in its place.</p>

<p>"By the beard of the Prophet, since I have not one of my
own to swear by, but we are a pretty pair of birds, Mansor!"</p>

<p>"If I may say so, your Highness, you are equally handsome as
a stork as when you were a Caliph," replied the Vizier. "I see
our two relations are conversing over there; shall we join them?"</p>

<p>When they came near to where the storks were smoothing
their feathers and touching bills in the most friendly manner,
this was the conversation they overheard, "Will you have some
of my frog's legs for breakfast, Dame Yellowlegs?" "No,
thank you; I am obliged to practise a dance for my father's
guests, and cannot eat." Thereupon Dame Yellowlegs stepped
out, and began to pose most gracefully. The Caliph and the
Vizier watched her, until she stood on one foot and spread her
wings; then they both, at the same time, burst into such peals of
laughter that the two storks flew away.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, the Vizier ceased his mirth, and commenced
bowing to the east. The Caliph recovered himself
and did the same, but neither could think of the magic word.</p>

<p>"Mansor, just recall that unholy word, and I will become
Caliph once more, and you my Grand Vizier. I have had
enough of being a bird for one day."</p>

<p>"Most gracious lord, that dancing stork has undone us, for,
since laughing at her antics, I cannot remember the word that
will restore us to human shape."</p>

<p>So at last, in despair, the two unhappy birds wandered
through the meadows. They appeased their hunger with
fruits, for they could not bring themselves to eat frogs and
lizards. As they dared not return to Bagdad and tell the people
their chagrin, they flew over the city, and had the satisfaction
of seeing signs of mourning and confusion. In a few days,
however, while sitting on the roof of a house, they saw a splendid
procession coming up the street, and the people welcoming
the new ruler. "Hail! Hail Mirza, ruler of Bagdad!" they
shouted.</p>

<p>The procession came nearer. At the head of it the Caliph
<span class="left"><a name="page471" id="page471"></a>[page&nbsp;471]</span>
saw a man dressed in scarlet and gold, riding a handsome
horse. He at once recognized the new ruler as the son of his
worst enemy.</p>

<p>"Behold," said he, "the explanation of our enchantment!
This is the son of Kaschnur, the magician, who is my great
enemy, who seeks revenge. Let us not lose hope, but fly to the
sacred grave of the Prophet and pray to be released from the
spell."</p>

<p>They at once spread their wings and soared away toward
Medina, but not being accustomed to such long flights, they soon
became fatigued and descended to a ruin which stood in a
valley below. The two enchanted birds decided to remain there
for the night; then wandered through the deserted rooms and
corridors, which gave of evidence of former splendor. Suddenly
the Vizier stopped and remarked that if it were not ridiculous
for a stork to be afraid of ghosts, he would feel decidedly nervous.
The Caliph listened, and heard a low moaning and sobbing,
which seemed to come from a room down the passage. He
started to rush toward it, but the Vizier held him fast by a wing.
He had retained the brave heart that he had possessed
when a Caliph, however, and freeing himself from the Vizier's
bill, he hurried to the room whence came the pitiful sounds. The
moon shone through a barred window and showed him a screech
owl sitting on the floor of the ruined chamber, lamenting in a
hoarse voice. The Vizier had cautiously stolen up beside the
Caliph; and at sight of the two storks, the screech owl uttered a
cry of pleasure. To their astonishment it addressed them in
Arabic, in the following words:</p>

<p>"I have abandoned myself to despair, but I believe my
deliverance is near, for it was prophesied in my youth that a
stork would bring me good fortune."</p>

<p>The Caliph, thus appealed to, arched his neck most gracefully
and replied:</p>

<p>"Alas! Screech Owl, I fear we are unable to aid you, as
you will understand when you have heard our miserable story."</p>

<p>He then related how the magician, Kaschnur, had changed
them into storks and made his own son ruler of Bagdad. The
screech owl became very much excited and exclaimed:</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page472" id="page472"></a>[page&nbsp;472]</span>
<p>
"How strange that misfortune should have come to us
through the same man. I am Tusa, the daughter of the King of
the Indies. The magician, Kaschnur, came one day to my
father, to ask my hand in marriage for his son Mirza. My father
ordered him thrown down stairs, and in revenge he managed to
have me given a powder which changed me into this hideous
shape. He then conveyed me to this lonely castle, and swore I
should remain here until some one asked me to be his wife, and
so freed me from the enchantment."</p>

<p>At the conclusion of her story, the screech owl wept anew and
would not be consoled. Suddenly, however, she wiped her eyes
on her wing and said:</p>

<p>"I have an idea that may lead to our deliverance. Once
every month the magician, Kaschnur, and his companions meet
in a large hall at this castle, where they feast and relate their
evil deeds. We will listen outside the door, and perhaps you
may hear the forgotten word. Then, when you have resumed
human form, one of you can ask to marry me, that I too may
be freed from this wretched enchantment; and the prophecy
that a stork would bring me happiness would be fulfilled."</p>

<p>The Caliph and the Vizier withdrew and consulted over the
situation. "It is unfortunate," said the Caliph, "but if we are
to meet again, I think you will have to ask the screech owl to
marry you."</p>

<p>"Not so, your Highness, I already have a wife, and would
rather remain a stork forever than take another; besides, I am
an old man, while you are young and unmarried, and much
better suited to a beautiful Princess."</p>

<p>"That is it," said the Caliph. "How do I know that she
will not prove to be some old fright?" As the Vizier was firm,
the Caliph at last said he would take the chances and do as the
screech owl required.</p>

<p>That very night it so happened that the magicians met at the
ruined castle. The screech owl led the two storks through
difficult passages till they came to a hole in the wall, through
which they could plainly see all that transpired in the lighted
hall. Handsomely carved pillars adorned the room, and a table
was spread with many dishes. About the table sat eight men,
<span class="left"><a name="page473" id="page473"></a>[page&nbsp;473]</span>
among whom was their enemy, the magician. He entertained
the company with many stories, and at last came to his latest&mdash;that
of turning the Caliph and Vizier into storks&mdash;in relating
which he pronounced the magic word. The storks did not wait
to hear more, but ran to the door of the castle. The screech
owl followed as fast as she could, and when the Caliph saw her he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"To prove my gratitude, O our deliverer! I beg you to take
me for your husband."</p>

<p>Then the two storks faced the rising sun, and bowed their
long necks three times. "Matabor!" they solemnly cried,
together; and in an instant they were no longer storks, but stood
before each other in their natural forms. In their joy they fell
on each other's necks and forgot all about the screech owl, until
they heard a sweet voice beside them, and turning beheld a
beautiful Princess. When the Caliph recovered from his astonishment
he said that he was now, indeed, enchanted and hoped
to remain so always.</p>

<p>They then started at once for the gate of Bagdad; and when
they arrived, the people were overjoyed, for they had believed
their ruler dead. The magician was taken to the ruined castle
and hanged, and his son was given the choice of the black powder
or death. Choosing the powder, he was changed into a stork,
and was kept in the palace gardens.</p>

<p>Caliph Charid and the Princess were married; and when
their children grew old enough, the Caliph often amused them
with imitations of the Grand Vizier when he was a stork,&mdash;while
Mansor sat smiling and pulling his long beard.</p>

<p><b>E</b> that seeketh, shall find, and to him that knocketh
shall be opened," says an old Arab proverb.</p>

<p>"I will try that," said a youth one day. To carry out his
<span class="left"><a name="page474" id="page474"></a>[page&nbsp;474]</span>
intention he journeyed to Bagdad, where he presented himself
before the Vizier.</p>

<p>"Lord!" said he, "for many years I have lived a quiet
and solitary life, the monotony of which wearies me. I have
never permitted myself earnestly to will any thing. But as my
teacher daily repeated to me, 'He that seeketh shall find, and to
him that knocketh shall be opened,' so have I now come to the
resolution with might and heart to will, and the resolution of my
will is nothing less than to have the Caliph's daughter for my
wife."</p>

<p>The Vizier thought the poor man was mad, and told him to
call again some other time.</p>

<p>Perseveringly he daily returned, and never felt disconcerted at
the same often repeated answer. One day, the Caliph called on
the Vizier, as the youth was repeating his statement.</p>

<p>Full of astonishment the Caliph listened to the strange
demand, and being in no humor for having the poor youth's
head taken off, but on the contrary, being rather inclined for
pleasantry, his Mightiness condescendingly said: "For the great,
the wise, or the brave, to request a Princess for wife, is a moderate
demand; but what are your claims? To be the possessor
of my daughter you must distinguish yourself by one of these
attributes, or else by some great undertaking. Ages ago a
carbuncle of inestimable value was lost in the Tigris; he who
finds it shall have the hand of my daughter."</p>

<p>The youth, satisfied with the promise of the Caliph, went to
the shores of the Tigris. With a small vessel he went every
morning to the river, scooping out the water and throwing it on
the land; and after having for hours thus employed himself, he
knelt down and prayed. The fishes became at last uneasy at
his perseverance; and being fearful that, in the course of time, he
might exhaust the waters, they assembled in great council.</p>

<p>"What is the purpose of this man?" demanded the monarch
of the fishes.</p>

<p>"The possession of the carbuncle that lies buried in the
bottom of the Tigris," was the reply.</p>

<p>"I advise you, then," said the aged monarch, "to give it up to
him; for if he has the steady will, and has positively resolved
<span class="left"><a name="page475" id="page475"></a>[page&nbsp;475]</span>
to find it, he will work until he has drained the last drop of water
from the Tigris, rather than deviate a hair's breadth from his
purpose."</p>

<p>The fishes, out of fear, threw the carbuncle into the vessel of
the youth; and the latter, as a reward, received the daughter
of the Caliph for his wife."</p>

<p>"He who earnestly wills, can do much!"</p>

<h2>THE MOST FRUGAL OF MEN</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">A</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>MAN</b> who was considered the most frugal of all the
dwellers in a certain kingdom heard of another man
who was the most frugal in the whole world. He said to his son
thereupon: "We, indeed, live upon little, but if we were more
frugal still, we might live upon nothing at all. It will be well
worth while for us to get instructions in economy from the Most
Frugal of Men." The son agreed, and the two decided that
the son should go and inquire whether the master in economic
science would take pupils. An exchange of presents being a
necessary preliminary to closer intercourse, the father told the
son to take the smallest of coins, one farthing, and to buy a
sheet of paper of the cheapest sort. The boy, by bargaining,
got two sheets of paper for the farthing. The father put away
one sheet, cut the other sheet in halves, and on one half drew a
picture of a pig's head. This he put into a large covered basket,
as if it were the thing which it represented&mdash;the usual gift sent
in token of great respect. The son took the basket, and after
a long journey reached the abode of the most frugal man in the
world.</p>

<p>The master of the house was absent, but his son received
the traveler, learned his errand, and accepted the offering.
Having taken from the basket the picture of the pig's head,
he said courteously to his visitor: "I am sorry that we have
nothing in the house that is worthy to take the place of the
pig's head in your basket. I will, however, signify our friendly
reception of it by putting in four oranges for you to take home
with you."</p>

<p>Thereupon the young man, without having any oranges at
hand, made the motions necessary for putting the fruit into
<span class="left"><a name="page477" id="page477"></a>[page&nbsp;477]</span>
the basket. The son of the most frugal man in the kingdom
then took the basket and went to his father to tell of thrift
surpassing his own.</p>

<p>When the most frugal man in the world returned home, his
son told him that a visitor had been there, having come from
a great distance to take lessons in economy. The father inquired
what offering he brought as an introduction, and the
son showed the small outline of the pig's head on thin brown
paper. The father looked at it, and then asked his son what
he had sent as a return present. The son told him he had
merely made the motions necessary for transferring four oranges,
and showed how he had clasped the imaginary fruit and deposited
it in the visitor's basket. The father immediately flew into a
terrible rage and boxed the boy's ears, exclaiming: "You
extravagant wretch! With your fingers thus far apart you appeared
to give him large oranges. Why didn't you measure
out small ones?"</p>

<h2>THE MOON-CAKE</h2>

<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">A</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>LITTLE</b> boy had a cake that a big boy coveted. Designing
to get the cake without making the little boy
cry so loud as to attract his mother's attention, the big boy
remarked that the cake would be prettier if it were more like
the moon. The little boy thought that a cake like the moon
must be desirable, and on being assured by the big boy that he
had made many such, he handed over his cake for manipulation.
The big boy took out a mouthful, leaving a crescent with jagged
edge. The little boy was not pleased by the change, and began
to whimper; whereupon the big boy pacified him by saying that
he would make the cake into a half-moon. So he nibbled off
the horns of the crescent, and gnawed the edge smooth; but
when the half-moon was made, the little boy perceived that
there was hardly any cake left, and he again began to snivel. The
big boy again diverted him by telling him that, if he did not
<span class="left"><a name="page478" id="page478"></a>[page&nbsp;478]</span>
like so small a moon, he should have one that was just the size
of the real orb. He then took the cake, and explained that,
just before the new moon is seen, the old moon disappears.
Then he swallowed the rest of the cake and ran off, leaving the
little boy waiting for the new moon.</p>

<h2>THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> there was an old woman who lived on what she got
by wile from her relatives and neighbors. Her husband's
brother lived alone with his only son, in a house near
hers, and when the son brought home a wife the old woman
went to call on the bride. During the call she inquired of
the bride whether she had not, since her arrival in the house,
heard a scratching at night among the boxes containing her
wedding outfit. The bride said she had not. A few days
later the old woman came again, and during the visit the
bride remarked that, before the matter was mentioned, she
had heard no scratching among her boxes, but that since that
time she had listened for it, and had heard it every night.
The old woman advised her to look carefully after her clothing,
saying that there were evidently many mice in the house,
and that she would be likely at any time to find her best garments
nibbled into shreds. The old woman knew there was
no cat in the house, but she inquired whether there was one,
and on hearing that there was not, she offered to lend the
young woman her own black-and-white cat, saying that it
would soon extirpate all the mice. The bride accepted the
loan, and the old woman brought the cat, and left it in the
bride's apartment. After a few hours the cat disappeared,
and the bride, supposing it to have gone home, made no search
for it. It did, indeed, go home, and the old woman secretly
disposed of it; but several days later she came to the young
woman and said that, when she lent the cat, her house had
been free from mice, but that, as soon as the cat was gone,
<span class="left"><a name="page479" id="page479"></a>[page&nbsp;479]</span>
the mice came and multiplied so fast that now everything was
overrun by them, and she would be obliged to take the cat
home again. The young woman told her that the cat went
away the same day that it came, and she had supposed it had
gone home. The old woman said it had not, and that nothing
could compensate her for the loss of it, for she had reared it
herself; that there was never before seen such a cat for catching
mice; that a cat, spotted as that one was, was seldom
found; and that it was of the rare breed which gave rise to the
common saying:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"A coal-black cat, with snowy loins,</p>
<p>Is worth its weight in silver coins."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>and that the weight of her cat was two hundred ounces.</p>

<p>The young woman was greatly surprised by this estimate
of the value of the lost cat, and went to her father-in-law and
related all that had occurred. The father-in-law, knowing
the character of the old woman, could neither eat nor
sleep, so harassed was he by the expectation that she would
worry his daughter-in-law till the two hundred ounces of silver
should be paid. The young woman, being a new-comer,
thought but lightly of the matter, till the old woman came
again and again to make mention of the cat. When it became
apparent that she must defend herself, the young woman
asked her father-in-law if he had ever lent anything to the old
woman; and when he said he could not remember having
lent anything, she begged him to think carefully, and see if
he could not recall the loan of a tool, a dish, or a fagot. He
finally recollected that he had lent to her an old wooden ladle,
but he said it originally cost but a few farthings, and was certainly
not worth speaking about.</p>

<p>The next time the old woman came to dun for the amount
due for her cat, the young woman asked her to return the borrowed
ladle. The old woman said that the ladle was old and
valueless; that she had allowed the children to play with it,
and that they had dropped it in the dirt, where it had lain until
she had picked it up and used it for kindlings. The bride
responded: "You expect to enrich yourself and your family
by means of your cat. I and my family also want money.
<span class="left"><a name="page480" id="page480"></a>[page&nbsp;480]</span>
Since you cannot give back the ladle, we will both go before
the magistrate and present our cases. If your cat is adjudged
to be worth more than my ladle I will pay you the excess;
and if my ladle be worth more than your cat, then you must
pay me." Being sure that the cat would, by any judge, be
considered of greater value than the ladle, the old woman
agreed to the proposition, and the two went before the magistrate.
The young woman courteously gave precedence to the
elder, and allowed her to make the accusation. The old
woman set forth her case, and claimed two hundred ounces
of silver as a compensation for the loss of the cat. When she
had concluded her statement, the judge called on the young
woman for her defense. She said she could not disprove the
statement, but that the claim was offset by a ladle that had
been borrowed by the plaintiff. There was a common saying:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"In the moon overhead, at its full, you can see</p>
<p>The trunk, branch and leaf of a cinnamon tree."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>A branch from this tree had one night been blown down
before her father-in-law's door, and he had had a ladle made
from the wood. Whatever the ladle was put into never diminished
by use. Whether wine, oil, rice, or money, the bulk
remained the same if no ladle beside this one were used in
dipping it. A foreign inn-keeper, hearing of this ladle, came
and offered her father-in-law three thousand ounces of silver
for it, but the offer was refused. And this ladle was the one
that the plaintiff had borrowed and destroyed.</p>

<p>The magistrate, on hearing this defense, understood that
the cat had been a pretext for extortion, and decided that the
two claims offset each other, so that no payment was due from
either one.</p>

<h2>THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HERE</b> was once a family consisting of a father, his
three sons, and his two daughters-in-law. The two
daughters-in-law, wives of the two elder sons, had but recently
<span class="left"><a name="page481" id="page481"></a>[page&nbsp;481]</span>
been brought into the house, and were both from one village a
few miles away. Having no mother-in-law living, they were
obliged to appeal to their father-in-law whenever they wished
to visit their former homes, and as they were lonesome and
homesick they perpetually bothered the old man by asking leave
of absence.</p>

<p>Vexed by these constant petitions, he set himself to invent
a method of putting an end to them, and at last gave them
leave in this wise: "You are always begging me to allow
you to go and visit your mothers, and thinking that I am very
hard-hearted because I do not let you go. Now you may
go, but only upon condition that when you come back you
will each bring me something I want. The one shall bring
me some fire wrapped in paper, and the other some wind in a
paper. Unless you promise to bring me these, you are never to
ask me to let you go home; and if you go, and fail to get these
for me, you are never to come back."</p>

<p>The old man did not suppose that these conditions would
be accepted, but the girls were young and thoughtless, and
in their anxiety to get away did not consider the impossibility
of obtaining the articles required. So they made ready with
speed, and in great glee started off on foot to visit their mothers.
After they had walked a long distance, chatting about what they
should do and whom they should see in their native village, the
high heel of one of them slipped from under her foot, and she fell
down. Owing to this mishap both stopped to adjust the
misplaced footgear, and while doing this the conditions under
which alone they could return to their husbands came to mind,
and they began to cry.</p>

<p>While they sat there crying by the roadside a young girl
came riding along from the fields on a water buffalo. She
stopped and asked them what was the matter, and whether
she could help them. They told her she could do them no
good; but she persisted in offering her sympathy and inviting
their confidence, till they told their story, and then she at
once said that if they would go home with her she would show
them a way out or their trouble. Their case seemed so hopeless
to themselves, and the child was so sure of her own power
<span class="left"><a name="page482" id="page482"></a>[page&nbsp;482]</span>
to help them, that they finally accompanied her to her father's
house, where she showed them how to comply with their father-in-law's
demand.</p>

<p>For the first a paper lantern only would be needed. When
lighted it would be a fire, and its paper surface would compass
the blaze, so that it would truly be "some fire wrapped
in paper." For the second a paper fan would suffice. When
flapped, wind would issue from it, and the "wind wrapped in
paper" could thus be carried to the old man.</p>

<p>The two young women thanked the wise child, and went
on their way rejoicing. After a pleasant visit to their old
homes, they took a lantern and a fan, and returned to their
father-in-law's house. As soon as he saw them he began to
vent his anger at their light regard for his commands, but
they assured him that they had perfectly obeyed him, and
showed him that what they had brought fulfilled the conditions
prescribed. Much astonished, he inquired how it was
that they had suddenly become so astute, and they told him
the story of their journey, and of the little girl who had so
opportunely come to their relief. He inquired whether the
little girl was already betrothed, and, finding that she was not,
engaged a go-between to see if he could get her for a wife
for his youngest son.</p>

<p>Having succeeded in securing the girl as a daughter-in-law,
he brought her home, and told all the rest of the family that
as there was no mother in the house, and as this girl had shown
herself to be possessed of extraordinary wisdom, she should be
the head of the household.</p>

<p>The wedding festivities being over, the sons of the old man
made ready to return to their usual occupations on the farm;
but, according to their father's order, they came to the young
bride for instructions. She told them that they were never
to go to or from the fields empty-handed. When they went
they must carry fertilizers of some sort for the land, and when
they returned they must bring bundles of sticks for fuel. They
obeyed, and soon had the land in fine condition, and so much
fuel gathered that none need be bought. When there were
no more sticks, roots, or weeds to bring; she told them to bring
<span class="left"><a name="page483" id="page483"></a>[page&nbsp;483]</span>
stones instead; and they soon accumulated an immense pile of
stones, which were heaped in a yard near their house.</p>

<p>One day an expert in the discovery of precious stones came
along, and saw in this pile a block of jade of great value. In
order to get possession of this stone at a small cost, he undertook
to buy the whole heap, pretending that he wished to
use it in building. The little head of the family asked an
exorbitant price for them, and, as he could not induce her to
take less, he promised to pay her the sum she asked, and to
come two days later to bring the money and to remove the
stones. That night the girl thought about the reason for the
buyer's being willing to pay so large a sum for the stones,
and concluded that the heap must contain a gem. The next
morning she sent her father-in-law to invite the buyer to supper,
and she instructed the men of her family in regard to
his entertainment. The best of wine was to be provided, and
the father-in-law was to induce him to talk of precious stones,
and to cajole him into telling in what way they were to be
distinguished from other stones.</p>

<p>The head of the family, listening behind a curtain, heard
how the valuable stone in her heap could be discovered. She
hastened to find and remove it from the pile; and, when her
guest had recovered from the effect of the banquet, he saw
that the value had departed from his purchase. He went to
negotiate again with the seller, and she conducted the conference
with such skill that she obtained the price originally
agreed upon for the heap of stones, and a large sum besides
for the one in her possession.</p>

<p>The family, having become wealthy, built an ancestral hall
of fine design and elaborate workmanship, and put the words
"No Sorrow" as an inscription over the entrance. Soon after,
a mandarin passed that way, and, noticing this remarkable
inscription, had his sedan-chair set down, that he might inquire
who were the people that professed to have no sorrow.
He sent for the head of the family, was much surprised on
seeing so young a woman thus appear, and remarked: "Yours
is a singular family. I have never before seen one without
sorrow, nor one with so young a head. I will fine you for
<span class="left"><a name="page484" id="page484"></a>[page&nbsp;484]</span>
your impudence. Go and weave me a piece of cloth as long as
this road."</p>

<p>"Very well," responded the little woman; "so soon as your
Excellency shall have found the two ends of the road, and
informed me as to the number of feet in its length, I will at
once begin the weaving."</p>

<p>Finding himself at fault, the mandarin added, "And I also
fine you as much oil as there is water in the sea."</p>

<p>"Certainly," responded the woman; "as soon as you shall
have measured the sea, and sent me correct information as to
the number of gallons, I will at once begin to press out the
oil from my beans."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said the mandarin, "since you are so sharp, perhaps
you can penetrate my thoughts. If you can, I will fine
you no more. I hold this pet quail in my hand; now tell me
whether I mean to squeeze it to death, or to let it fly in the
air."</p>

<p>"Well," said the woman, "I am an obscure commoner, and you
are a famed magistrate; if you are no more knowing than
I, you have no right to fine me at all. Now I stand with one
foot on one side my threshold and the other foot on the other
side; tell me whether I mean to go in or come out. If you
cannot guess my riddle, you should not require me to guess
yours."</p>

<p>Being unable to guess her intention the mandarin took his
departure, and the family lived long in opulence and good
repute under its chosen head.</p>

<h2>A DREADFUL BOAR</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">A</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>POOR</b> old woman who lived with her one little granddaughter
in a wood was out gathering sticks for fuel,
and found a green stalk of sugar-cane, which she added to her
bundle. She presently met an elf in the form of a wild Boar,
that asked her for the cane, but she declined giving it to him,
<span class="left"><a name="page485" id="page485"></a>[page&nbsp;485]</span>
saying that, at her age, to stoop and to rise again was to earn
what she picked up, and that she was going to take the cane
home, and let her little granddaughter suck its sap. The
Boar, angry at her refusal, said that he would, during the coming
night, eat her granddaughter instead of the cane, and went off
into the wood.</p>

<p>When the old woman reached her cabin she sat down by
the door and wailed, for she knew she had no means of defending
herself against the Boar. While she sat crying, a
vender of needles came along and asked her what was the
matter. She told him, and he said that all he could do for
her was to give her a box of needles. This he did, and went
on his way. The old woman stuck the needles thickly over
the lower half of her door, on its outer side, and then she went
on crying. Just then a man came along with a basket of
crabs, heard her lamentations, and stopped to inquire what
ailed her. She told him, and he said he knew no help for her,
but he would do the best he could for her by giving her half
his crabs. The old woman put the crabs in her water-jar,
behind her door, and again sat down and cried. A farmer
soon came along from the fields, leading his ox, and he also
asked the cause of her distress and heard her sad story. He
said he was sorry he could not think of any way of preventing
the evil she expected, but that he would leave his ox to stay
all night with her, as it might be a sort of company for her
in her loneliness. She led the ox into her cabin, tied it to the
head of her bedstead, gave it some straw, and then cried again.</p>

<p>A courier, returning on horseback from a neighboring town,
next passed her door, and dismounted to inquire what troubled
her. Having heard her tale, he said he would leave his horse
to stay with her, and make the ox more contented. So she
tied the horse to the foot of her bed, and, thinking how surely
evil was coming upon her with the night, she burst out crying
anew. A boy just then came along with a snapping-turtle
that he had caught, and stopped to ask what had happened to
her. On learning the cause of her weeping, he said it was
of no use to contend against sprites, but that he would give
her his snapping-turtle as a proof, of his sympathy. She took
<span class="left"><a name="page486" id="page486"></a>[page&nbsp;486]</span>
the turtle, tied it in front of her bedstead, and continued to
cry.</p>

<p>Some men who were carrying mill-stones then came along,
inquired into her trouble, and expressed their compassion by
giving her a mill-stone, which they rolled into her back yard.
A little later a man arrived carrying hoes and pickax, and
asked her why she was crying so hard. She told him her
grief, and he said he would gladly help her if he could, but
he was only a well-digger, and could do nothing for her other
than to dig her a well. She pointed out a place in the middle
of her back yard, and he went to work and quickly dug a well.</p>

<p>On his departure the old woman cried again, until a paper-seller
came and inquired what was the matter. When she
had told him, he gave her a large sheet of white paper, as a
token of pity, and she laid it smoothly over the mouth of the
well.</p>

<p>Nightfall came; the old woman shut and barred her door,
put her granddaughter snugly on the wall-side of the bed, and
then lay down beside her, to await the foe.</p>

<p>At midnight the Boar came, and threw himself against the
door to break it in. The needles wounded him sorely, so that
when he had gained an entrance he was heated and thirsty,
and went to the water-jar to drink. When he thrust in his
snout the crabs attacked him, clung to his bristles and pinched
his ears, till he rolled over and over to disencumber himself.
Then in a rage he approached the front of the bed, but the
snapping-turtle nipped his tail, and made him retreat under
the feet of the horse, who kicked him over to the ox, who
tossed him back to the horse; and thus beset he was glad to
escape to the back yard to take a rest, and to consider the
situation. Seeing a clean paper spread on the ground, he went
to lie upon it, and fell into the well. The old woman heard
the fall, rushed out, rolled the mill-stone down on him, and
crushed him.</p>

<h1>RUSSIAN STORIES</h1>

<hr class="short" />

<h2>KING KOJATA</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">K</span></p>
<p><b>ING</b> Kojata ruled over a mighty kingdom, and was
beloved by his subjects; but because he had no heir
to his crown, both he and the Queen lamented. Once, while
traveling through his territories, he came to a well that was
filled to the brim with clear cold water; and being very thirsty,
he stopped to drink. On the top of the water floated a golden
vessel, which the King attempted to seize; but just as his hand
touched it, away it floated to the other side of the well. He
went around to where the vessel rested and tried again, with
the same result. Every time the King touched the basin it
glided from his grasp. At last, losing patience, he gave up
trying to seize the vessel, and bending over the well, he began to
drink. His long beard had fallen into the water, and when he
had slaked his thirst and attempted to rise, he found himself
held fast by it. After vainly pulling and jerking for some time,
he looked down into the water and saw a hideous face grinning
at him. Its eyes were green and shining, its teeth showed from
ear to ear, and it held him by the beard with two bony claws.
In horror, the king tried to extricate himself, but a terrible
voice came from the depths of the well:</p>

<p>"You cannot get away, King Kojata, so do not make me
pull your beard too hard. There is something at the palace
of which you do not know; promise to give it to me, and I will
release you."</p>

<p>The King did not know of anything that could have arrived
at the palace during his absence worth the discomfort
he was experiencing; so he very readily gave his promise, and
was freed. When he had shaken the water from his beard,
he looked in the well for the ugly monster which had held him
<span class="left"><a name="page488" id="page488"></a>[page&nbsp;488]</span>
captive, but he was nowhere to be seen. Summoning his
attendants, he at once set out for home, where he arrived in a
few days. The people along the way hailed him with delight;
and when he reached the palace, the Queen led him to
the royal chamber and showed him a beautiful son that had
been born during his absence. His joy was so great that he
forgot all else; but after a time he recalled with horror his
compact with the monster of the well, and the meaning was
all plain to him. The thought of what he had promised haunted
him day and night, and the fear that something would happen
to his little son tortured him. But as days and months passed,
and the little Prince grew more beautiful all the time, the
King at last forgot his fears and became happy once more.</p>

<p>Years went by without anything happening to disturb his
peace of mind, and the Prince grew to be a beautiful youth, who
was the joy and pride of the King and Queen. One day he went
with the hunters to the forest, and while pursuing a wild boar,
became separated from them. He got farther and farther
away from his companions, and at last found himself alone in a
dark part of the wood where he never before had been. Not
knowing in which direction his path lay, he called again and
again to the hunters. At last a hoarse voice answered him, and
from the hollow trunk of a lime-tree appeared a hideous man
with green eyes and terrible teeth.</p>

<p>"I've waited for you a long time, Prince Milan," said he.</p>

<p>"Who on earth may you be?" asked the Prince.</p>

<p>"Your father will tell you who I am. Just give my greetings
to his Majesty, and tell him that I am ready to claim the debt
he owes me."</p>

<p>The green-eyed man then disappeared into the hollow tree
from which he came; and when the Prince reached home, he
related his experience to his father. The King turned white,
and cried:</p>

<p>"At last, it has come!" Then he explained to the Prince
what had occurred at the well, and added, "Now my happiness
is at an end, for you, my son, will be taken from me."</p>

<p>The Prince told the King not to despair, for though he
might go away, he was certain to return to him. His father
<span class="left"><a name="page489" id="page489"></a>[page&nbsp;489]</span>
provided him with a handsome horse with golden stirrups, and
the Queen gave him a cross to wear about his neck. When he
had said farewell to his unhappy parents, he mounted his horse
and rode for two days without stopping.</p>

<p>On the third day he came to a lake on whose smooth surface
thirty ducks were swimming, while spread about upon the
grass were thirty white garments. The Prince dismounted, and
taking up one of the garments, seated himself behind a bush and
waited to see what would happen. The ducks dived under the
water and disported themselves for a time, then came ashore
and putting on the little white garments, they became beautiful
maidens, and disappeared. But there was one little duck, that
remained on the lake and swam about in the most distracted
manner, uttering piteous cries. The Prince came from behind
the bush and the little duck begged him to give back her garment.
He had no sooner done so than before him stood the loveliest
maiden he had ever seen.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Prince Milan, for restoring my garment,"
said she. "My name is Hyacinthia, and I am one of the thirty
daughters of a King of the Underworld, to whose castle I will
lead you, for he has waited long for you. Approach him on
your knees and do not fear him, for I will be there to help you,
whatever happens."</p>

<p>She tapped her little foot on the ground, which opened; and
they were immediately transported to the palace of her father in
the Underworld, which was carved from a single carbuncle.
When his eyes became accustomed to the radiant light, the
Prince saw the magician of the lime-tree sitting on a dazzling
throne. His green eyes looked out from under a golden crown,
and his hideous claws clutched the air with rage when he saw
the Prince. Remembering what the maiden had told him,
Prince Milan walked boldly up to the throne and knelt at the
feet of the magician, who cursed in a voice that shook the
Underworld. As the youth was not at all frightened, the
magician at last stopped swearing. Laughing at his courage,
he welcomed him to his palace, and showed him to a beautiful
chamber which he was to occupy. On the following day he
sent for him and said;</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page490" id="page490"></a>[page&nbsp;490]</span>

<p>"You are very brave, Prince Milan, but you must pay the
penalty for keeping me waiting so long for you. To-night
build me a palace of gold and marble, with windows of crystal,
and about it the most beautiful gardens in the world, or tomorrow
I shall cut off your head."</p>

<p>The Prince went back to his chamber and sadly awaited
his doom. That evening a small bee flew in through his window,
and as soon as it entered the room it became Hyacinthia. "Why
are you sad, Prince Milan?" she asked. He told her of her
father's impossible command and added, "Naturally, I am not
happy at the thought of losing my head."</p>

<p>"Do not be distressed about that," said she, "but trust to
me." In the morning he looked out of the window and saw a
wonderful marble palace, with a roof of gold.</p>

<p>When the magician beheld it, he exclaimed, "You have
accomplished a great wonder, but I cannot let you off so easily.
To-morrow I will place my thirty daughters in a row, and if
you cannot tell me which one is the youngest, you will lose your
head."</p>

<p>The Prince, however, was not cast down at this, for he
thought he would have no trouble in recognizing Hyacinthia.
That evening the little bee entered the room and told him that
this task was quite as difficult as the first, because the sisters
were all exactly alike. "But you will know me," said she, "by a
little fly which you will discover on my cheek."</p>

<p>The next day the magician summoned him to his presence,
and showed him the thirty daughters standing in a row. The
Prince passed before them twice, without daring to choose; but
he saw the little fly on the pink cheek of one of the maidens.</p>

<p>"This is Hyacinthia!" exclaimed he. The magician was
greatly astonished; but not yet satisfied, he required of the
Prince still another task.</p>

<p>"If, before this candle burns to the bottom," said he, "you
make me a pair of boots reaching to my knees, I will let you go;
but if you fail, you will lose your head."</p>

<p>"Then we must fly, for I love you dearly," said Hyacinthia,
when the Prince had told her of this new task. She breathed on
the window-pane, and straightway it was covered with frost;
<span class="left"><a name="page491" id="page491"></a>[page&nbsp;491]</span>
then, leading Prince Milan from the chamber, she locked the
door, and they fled through the passage by which they had
entered the Underworld. Beside the smooth lake his horse
was still grazing, and mounting it, they were borne swiftly
away.</p>

<p>When the magician sent for the Prince to come to him, the
frozen breath replied to the messengers, and so delayed the
discovery of his escape. At last the magician lost patience and
ordered the door burst open. The frozen breath mocked at
him, and he hastened in pursuit of the fugitives.</p>

<p>"I hear the sound of horses' feet behind us," said Hyacinthia.
The Prince dismounted, and putting his ear to the ground,
answered, "Yes, they are near." Hyacinthia thereupon changed
herself into a river, and the Prince became a bridge, and his
horse a blackbird. Their pursuers, no longer finding their
footprints, were obliged to return to the magician, who cursed
them, and again sent them forth.</p>

<p>"I hear the sound of horses' feet behind us," again said
Hyacinthia. The Prince put his ear to the earth and said, "Yes,
they are nearly upon us." Thereupon Hyacinthia changed
herself, the Prince and the horse, all into a dense forest in which
many paths crossed, so that the followers were bewildered; and
they again returned to the magician.</p>

<p>"I hear horses' feet behind us," said Hyacinthia a third
time; and this time it was the magician himself. Hyacinthia
took the little cross from the neck of the Prince, and changed
herself into a church, the Prince into a monk, and the horse
into the belfry; so that when the magician came up he lost all
trace of them, and was obliged to return to the Underworld in
great chagrin.</p>

<p>When he had departed, the Prince and Hyacinthia mounted
the horse and rode till they came to a beautiful town.</p>

<p>"We must not enter," said she, "for we may not come out
again." But the Prince would not take her advice, and insisted
upon passing through the gates.</p>

<p>"Then," sadly replied the maiden, "when the King and
Queen of the town come out to meet you, do not kiss the little
child which they will lead by the hand, or you will forget me
<span class="left"><a name="page492" id="page492"></a>[page&nbsp;492]</span>
and never come back. As for me, I will become a milestone
and wait for you here."</p>

<p>It was all as Hyacinthia had said. The King and Queen
came out to greet him, and when the lovely little child ran up to
him for a caress, he kissed its pretty face and forgot Hyacinthia.</p>

<p>The first and second day went by; and when the third day
came, Hyacinthia wept, and became a little blue flower growing
by the roadside. An old man came along, and digging up the
flower carried it home with him and planted it in his garden. He
watered and tended it carefully, and one day the little flower
became a beautiful maiden.</p>

<p>"Why did you not leave me to die by the roadside?" she
asked, and told the old man her story.</p>

<p>"To-morrow is Prince Milan's wedding day," said the old man.</p>

<p>Hyacinthia at once dried her tears, and presented herself at
the palace, dressed like a peasant. She went to the cook and
asked to be allowed to make the wedding cake. The cook was so
struck with her beauty that he could not refuse the request.
When the guests were all seated about the table, Prince Milan
was called upon to cut the cake. As soon as he had done so, out
flew two beautiful doves, which circled about his head.</p>

<p>"Dear mate," cried one of the doves, "do not leave me as
Prince Milan left Hyacinthia."</p>

<p>The Prince, who suddenly recollected all he had forgotten,
ran from the room and at the door found Hyacinthia and his
horse awaiting him. They mounted and rode swiftly away to
the kingdom of King Kojata, where the King and Queen received
them with tears of joy, and they all lived in happiness to the end
of their days.</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF KING FROST</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">A</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>SHREWISH</b> peasant woman had a daughter on whom she
lavished everything she could get, and a stepdaughter
whom she neglected and ill treated. In the mother's eyes the
daughter had no faults, while the stepdaughter was always
<span class="left"><a name="page493" id="page493"></a>[page&nbsp;493]</span>
blamed, and, try as she might, the poor girl never could please.
So unhappy was she made that her eyes were often red from
weeping. The sight of her tear-stained face only angered the
stepmother the more, and caused her to say to the girl's father:</p>

<p>"Send her away, old man. My eyes are tired of the sight
of her, and my ears of the sound of her voice. Send her out of
the house."</p>

<p>The father begged to have his daughter remain, but the
shrew was determined to be rid of her, and gave him no peace.
At last, when he could gainsay her no longer, he placed his
daughter in a sledge and drove her to the open fields. Here he
left her, with nothing to shield her from the bitter cold. Kissing
her good-by, he drove away, not daring to look back at Her.</p>

<p>Left alone by her father, the girl wandered across the bleak
fields to the edge of the forest, where she sat down under a fir-tree
and wept. A crackling sound caused her to look up, and
she saw King Frost springing from one tree to another. When
he reached the fir-tree he jumped down beside her with a
bound. Snapping his fingers in her lovely face, he asked:</p>

<p>"Do you know who I am? I will tell you. I am King
Frost."</p>

<p>"Hail to you, great King!" smiled the maiden. "Have
you come for me?"</p>

<p>"Are you warm, fair maiden?" he asked in answer.</p>

<p>"Yes, quite warm, King Frost," the maiden replied, although
she was shivering.</p>

<p>King Frost bent over her and snapped his fingers about her,
until the air seemed full of needles. Again he asked, "Are you
still warm, dear maiden?"</p>

<p>Her lips could scarcely move to utter the words, "Quite
warm, King Frost."</p>

<p>He snapped his teeth and cracked his fingers, till all the air
was filled with stinging things. His eyes glistened and for the
last time he asked, "Are you warm, now, beautiful maiden?
Are you still warm, my dear?"</p>

<p>She was now scarcely able to speak, but managed to gasp,
"Still warm, King Frost."</p>

<p>The gentle girl's patience and uncomplaining endurance
<span class="left"><a name="page494" id="page494"></a>[page&nbsp;494]</span>
caused King Frost to take pity on her suffering. He arrayed
her in a robe, embroidered in silver and gold, and decked her
with sparkling diamonds. She glittered and shone, and was
dazzling to behold. Then placing her in his sleigh, he wrapped
her in furs; and six white horses bore them swiftly away.</p>

<p>The stepmother, at home, was baking pancakes for the
girl's funeral feast. "Go in the field," she said to her husband,
"and bring your daughter's body home, so we can bury her."
The old man rose to obey, when the little dog barked:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Your daughter shall not die;</p>
<p>Her's cold and stiff shall lie."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The woman kicked the dog, then tried to coax it with a
pancake, telling it to say:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Her daughter shall have gold;</p>
<p>His be frozen stiff and cold."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>When the little dog had swallowed the pancake, he barked:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"His daughter shall be wed;</p>
<p>Her's shall be frozen dead."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The woman beat the dog, then coaxed it with more pancakes;
but the blows could not terrify it nor food persuade. It barked
always the same. Suddenly the door opened, and a huge
chest was thrust into the room, followed by the radiant stepdaughter,
in a dress that dazzled them with its beauty.</p>

<p>As soon as the stepmother recovered from her astonishment,
she ordered her husband to yoke the horses to the sledge, and
take her own daughter to the field. "Take care you leave her
in the same place," the old woman cautioned. The father
left the girl as he was bidden, and returned to his home.</p>

<p>She was not long alone when King Frost came by.</p>

<p>"Are you warm, maiden?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You must be a fool not to see that my hands and feet are
nearly frozen," she angrily replied.</p>

<p>The King danced in front of her, and cracked his fingers.</p>

<p>"Are you warm, maiden?" he asked her, over and over.
She cried with rage, and called him rude names, until he froze
the words on her lips, and she was dead.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page495" id="page495"></a>[page&nbsp;495]</span>
<p>
The mother waited for her daughter's return until she became
impatient; then she told her husband to take the sledge and go
for her. "But don't lose the chest," she added.</p>

<p>The dog under the table, barked:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Your daughter frozen cold,</p>
<p>Will never need a chest of gold."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The old woman was scolding the dog for telling lies, when
the door opened. Rushing out to welcome her daughter and
her treasures, she clasped the frozen body in her arms; and the
chill of it killed her.</p>

<p><b>LEASE</b>, I'm lost." These words, and a thump! thump!
on the door were what Mrs. Stone heard as she sat at
supper in her tiny house in the wood.</p>

<p>She went to open the door, and there she saw a dear little
girl about three years old.</p>

<p>"Please, I'm lost," again came the words, and two fat little
fists went up to a pair of big blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Come in, little girl, and tell me all about it," said the
woman. "Maybe I can help you to find your way."</p>

<p>The child let herself be led into the room; then all at once

gave a quick look at the table.</p>

<p>"Are you having supper?" she said. "May I have supper
too? I am ever so hungry."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; of course you shall have some," was the reply.
"See, you shall sit on this chair by my side. Now what will
you have?"</p>

<p>"I think I would like some bread and butter with sugar on
it&mdash;brown sugar, you know;" and soon the little girl was as
happy as could be.</p>

<p>"What is your name, dear?" asked Mrs. Stone, when
supper was over and the little girl had begun to think once
more about how she was to find her way home.</p>

<p>"Meg," was the reply.</p>

<p>"But your other name, for you must have two names."</p>

<p>"No, my name is just Meg, of course; I don't have any
other name," she said, a look of wonder in the big blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you know where you live?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I lives in the nursery. Didn't you know that?"</p>

<p>She was so sure that it did not seem any good to say any
more about it. So Mrs. Stone only asked, "Where were you
going when you came to my house?"</p>

<p>"To find a baby," was the reply. "Rob said that if I went
<span class="left"><a name="page499" id="page499"></a>[page&nbsp;499]</span>
to a house in the wood they would give me one. Have you got
a baby to give me?"</p>

<p>"No, dear; I am afraid I have not. But why do you want
a baby? I am sure you have lots of dolls."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I have; but then you see dolls are not
alive. I want a real baby to play with.</p>

<p>"Enid won't play with me much now, for she says I am
too small, and Rob is at school all the time."</p>

<p>"Why, who is that?" said a voice, and a man came in with
a bag of tools.</p>

<p>Then the two little fists again went up to the blue eyes,
for the little maid was shy of this great big man.</p>

<p>"Well, wife, so you have a friend, I see," he said. "Who
is the little lass?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said his wife. "It seems she was lost, and
came here to ask her way. She says she came to find a baby."</p>

<p>"Come here, little one, and don't be afraid," said the man.
"There never was a child yet who would not come to me,"
and as he spoke he drew her on to his knee. "Now, then, tell
me all about it."</p>

<p>After one glance at the man's kind face Meg nestled up to
him and began,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nurse was so busy she could not be in the room with me.</p>

<p>"So I put on my hat and came to look for a baby; but I
got lost on the way. At last I came to the wood and saw this
house. She could not give me a baby as Rob said she would,
but she gave me some tea, and bread and butter with sugar on
it. We only have that on Sunday at home. Is this Sunday?"</p>

<p>"No, little miss," said the man. "But I expect you had it
just for a treat, as you had got lost."</p>

<p>But just then steps were heard on the path, and there was
a sharp knock at the door.</p>

<p>The latch was lifted, and a voice said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you seen a little girl in a white frock pass this way?"</p>

<p>"Why, that must be Nurse," cried Meg.</p>

<p>In spite of being cross at Meg's having run away, Nurse
had to laugh; then she bent down and said, "But what made
you run away like this, Miss Meg?"</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page500" id="page500"></a>[page&nbsp;500]</span>
<p>
"Rob told me that if I came to the house in the wood I
should find a real live baby; but he was wrong, for she," with
a smile at Mrs. Stone, "is very nice, but she has not got a
baby to give me."</p>

<p>"Of course not, child; but do you know that I have some
news for you?"</p>

<p>"What is it? Do tell me?" cried the little girl.</p>

<p>"While you were away in the wood to look for a baby we
have found a baby at home. You have a new baby brother.
Come home with me now and you shall see him."</p>

<p>"A new little brother," said Meg, her eyes wide open with
wonder. "He must have known I had gone out to look for
one. So now I have got two new friends and a baby too.
Come along, quick."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she said to her new friends. "Thank you
ever so much for being so kind, and for the supper.</p>

<p>"I am coming to have supper with you again soon, and
then I will bring the new baby with me. You will give me
and baby bread and butter with sugar on it, won't you?" and
Meg trotted off as happy as a little queen.</p>

<h2>JOCK AND I AND THE OTHERS</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">F</span></p>
<p><b>IRST</b> of all, I must tell you who I am.</p>

<p>My name is PE-NEL-O-PE, but Jock always calls me Pen.
I am eight years old; Jock is half-past six.</p>

<p>We live with mother and father and Rover and Tibby in a
house not very far from a large city.</p>

<p>Mother is the nicest person I know in all the world.</p>

<p>Father is a very big man. He always has lots of money
in his pocket. He goes to business in a train every day.</p>

<p>We have a real farm, quite near to our house, where they
keep cows, chickens, pigs, horses, and geese. Jock and I often
go to see them all.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page501" id="page501"></a>[page&nbsp;501]</span>

<p>One day in summer we went to see the farmer. I had my
blue dress on, so that the cows would not be angry when they
saw me.</p>

<p>We met the farmer near the stable. "Come," he said; "I
have something to show you to-day."</p>

<p>"What is it?" we said both at the same time.</p>

<p>"Come and see," was all that he would say.</p>

<p>Then he took us into the stable where he keeps Nobby,
the big brown horse, who likes sugar.</p>

<p>Now Nobby was not there, but in the straw were seven
little puppy dogs&mdash;oh, so sweet and cuddly!</p>

<p>Jock danced round and round the farmer. "May we have
one?" he said.</p>

<p>"Ask mother," said the farmer, and off we ran at once.</p>

<p>Mother was at the garden gate.</p>

<p>We ran up to her. Jock was first, but it was nearly a dead
heat. Mother opened the gate and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, what have you seen to-day?"</p>

<p>"O mother," said Jock, out of breath.</p>

<p>"O mother <i>dear</i>" I said, out of breath also.</p>

<p>"Farmer has such lovely puppies," we both said at once.
"May we have one to keep?"</p>

<p>By this time we both had our arms round mother's waist,
and she was laughing.</p>

<p>"Yes, we can," I said, for I <i>knew</i>.</p>

<p>"If <i>father</i> says yes," said mother. "You must ask him
when he comes home."</p>

<p>So we went to the station to meet him. Jock took his bag,
and I took his paper parcel to carry it home for him.</p>

<p>On the way home I asked him if he liked dogs, and he
said, "Of course."</p>

<p>Then Jock said, "<i>Little</i> dogs?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"<i>Puppy</i> dogs?"</p>

<p>"One at a time is all right."</p>

<p>"One puppy dog with brown spots on white?" Jock went on.</p>

<p>"Where is it?" asked father, and his eyes were laughing;
you could not see his mouth for his beard.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page502" id="page502"></a>[page&nbsp;502]</span>

<p>Then we told him, and he said "Yes," just at the garden
gate. So that was how we got Rover.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Rover was very soft and downy when he first came to us.
But he soon grew to be a big dog.</p>

<p>Jock and I taught him many tricks; and he can beg very
nicely, if we let him get on the couch in the dining-room.</p>

<p>We put sugar on his nose, and he waits until we count One,
Two, THREE.</p>

<p>Then he throws the sugar into the air and catches it.</p>

<h2>DOLLY DIMPLE</h2>

<h4>BY F. TAPSELL</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:0.9em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">"</span><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>H</b> dear, I am so lonely, and it is so dark! I do want my
dear Dolly Dimple. I think I will go and fetch her."
And little four-year-old Babs got out of bed and felt her way
to the door.</p>

<p>The door was just a wee crack open. As she peeped in,
Babs saw that there was a light in the room, and the sight
which met her eyes almost made her cry out.</p>

<p>On the floor stood Dolly Dimple in her very best frock,
and Mr. Jollyman was asking her to dance with him.</p>

<p>Teddy Bear was at work on the big drum, and the clown
was turning the organ to make music for the dolls to dance to.</p>

<p>The tin soldiers, on the backs of cows, pigs, and sheep
from the Noah's Ark were having a sham fight.</p>

<p>The dolls from the dolls' house were going for a ride in
the big horse and cart.</p>

<p>"It is too bad of them to go and have a good time like this
when I am in bed," thought Babs, "and I am going to take
Dolly Dimple away with me all the same."</p>

<p>But when she tried to pick up the doll and carry her off,
Mr. Jollyman flew at her in a fury.</p>

<p>He began to kick her bare legs till Babs thought she would
have no shins left at all; but she would not run away.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page503" id="page503"></a>[page&nbsp;503]</span>

<p>"I want Dolly Dimple," she said. "She is my doll, and
you have no right to try to keep her away from me."</p>

<p>"She is yours in the day, but not at night," was the reply.</p>

<p>"How do you think we toys could live if we had no life
but the one we endure at your hands? It is in the night that
we live and have our good times, for we know you are safe in
bed then."</p>

<p>"I don't care what you say; I will have her," cried Babs,
very angry now.</p>

<p>She tried once more to get hold of Dolly Dimple; but before
she could do so, Mr. Jollyman turned to the soldiers,
and said the one word, "Charge."</p>

<p>There was a great noise and a rush, and right down upon
the little girl came camels, horses, lions, tigers, sheep, and
pigs.</p>

<p>But just as she thought her last hour was come, she heard,
the word "Halt," and then the sound of Dolly Dimple saying,
"No, don't kill her. She is very good to me most of the time."</p>

<p>The rest of the dolls had begun to dance once more, but
Dolly Dimple came up to the little girl and took hold of her
arm.</p>

<p>"I am queen here in the night," she said. "I will not hurt
you, as you have been good to me, and I know you love me.
If you like, I will come and stay with you till you go to sleep.
Pick me up."</p>

<p>So Babs picked up the doll, and took it back to bed with
her, and hugged it in her arms.</p>

<h2>THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT</h2>

<h4>BY BEATRIX POTTER</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their
names were&mdash;Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-Tail, and Peter.
They lived with their Mother in a sandbank, underneath the
root of a very big fir-tree.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page504" id="page504"></a>[page&nbsp;504]</span>

<p>"Now, my dears," said old Mrs. Rabbit, one morning, "you
may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr.
McGregor's garden: your Father had an accident there; he
was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor."</p>

<p>"Now run along, and don't get into mischief. I am going
out."</p>

<p>Then old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella and
went through the wood to the baker's. She bought a loaf of
brown bread and five currant buns.</p>

<p>Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail, who were good little bunnies,
went down the lane to gather blackberries.</p>

<p>But Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to
Mr. McGregor's garden, and squeezed under the gate!</p>

<p>First he ate some lettuces and some French beans, and
then he ate some radishes; and then, feeling rather sick, he
went to look for some parsley.</p>

<p>But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he
meet but Mr. McGregor!</p>

<p>Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out
young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving
a rake and calling out, "Stop, thief!"</p>

<p>Peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over
the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.
He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other
shoe amongst the potatoes.</p>

<p>After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster,
so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had
not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught
by the large buttons on his jacket. It was a blue jacket with
brass buttons, quite new.</p>

<p>Peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his
sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to
him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself.</p>

<p>Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve, which he intended
to pop upon the top of Peter, but Peter wriggled out just in
time, leaving his jacket behind him; and rushed into the tool-shed,
and jumped into a can. It would have been a beautiful
thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page505" id="page505"></a>[page&nbsp;505]</span>

<p>Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere
in the tool-shed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot. He
began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.</p>

<p>Presently Peter sneezed&mdash;"Kerty-schoo!" Mr. McGregor
was after him in no time, and tried to put his foot upon Peter,
who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants. The
window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of
running after Peter. He went back to his work.</p>

<p>Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling
with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go.
Also he was very damp with sitting in that can.</p>

<p>After a time he began to wander about, going lippity-lippity&mdash;not
very fast, and looking all around.</p>

<p>He found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there
was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.</p>

<p>An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep,
carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood. Peter
asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea
in her mouth that she could not answer. She only shook her
head at him. Peter began to cry.</p>

<p>Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden,
but he became more and more puzzled. Presently, he came
to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans. A white
cat was staring at some goldfish; she sat very, very still, but
now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive.
Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he
had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny.</p>

<p>He went back toward the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite
close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe&mdash;scr-r-ritch, scratch,
scratch, scratch. Peter scuttered underneath the bushes. But,
presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon
a wheelbarrow, and peeped over. The first thing he saw was
Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back was turned toward
Peter, and beyond him was the gate!</p>

<p>Peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow, and
started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk
behind some black-currant bushes.</p>

<p>Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but
<span class="left"><a name="page506" id="page506"></a>[page&nbsp;506]</span>
Peter did not care. He slipped underneath the gate, and was
safe at last in the wood outside the garden.</p>

<p>Mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for
a scarecrow to frighten the blackbirds.</p>

<p>Peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he
got home to the big fir-tree.</p>

<p>He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft
sand on the floor of the rabbit-hole, and shut his eyes.</p>

<p>His mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had
done with his clothes. It was the second little jacket and pair
of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight!</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the
evening.</p>

<p>His mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea;
and she gave a dose of it to Peter!</p>

<p>"One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time."</p>

<p>But Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail had bread and milk
and blackberries for supper.</p>

<h2>THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> upon a time there was a miller who lived in a little
house beside his mill. All day long he worked hard, but
at night he went home to his wife and his little boy.</p>

<p>One day this miller made up his mind that he would take
his ass to the fair and sell it. So he and his boy said farewell
to the dame and started off. They had not gone far when they
met a number of girls coming from the town.</p>

<p>"Look!" said one of them. "Did you ever see such stupid
fellows? They are walking when one of them might be riding."</p>

<p>When the miller heard this he bade the boy get up on the
ass, while he tramped along merrily by its side. Soon they
came to a number of old men standing by the side of the road
talking together.</p>

<p>"Look at that," said one of them, "Look at that young
<span class="left"><a name="page507" id="page507"></a>[page&nbsp;507]</span>
rascal riding, while his poor father has to walk. Get down,
you idle fellow, and let your father ride."</p>

<p>Upon this the son got down from the ass, and the miller
took his place. They had not gone very far when they met
two women coming home from market.</p>

<p>"You lazy old man!" they cried at once. "How dare you
ride when your poor little boy is walking and can hardly keep
pace with you?"</p>

<p>Then the miller, who was a good-natured man, took his son
up behind him, and in this way they went to the town.</p>

<p>"My good fellow," said a townsman whom they met, "is
that ass your own?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the miller.</p>

<p>"I should not have thought so, by the way you load him,"
said the man. "Why, you two are better able to carry the
beast than he is to carry you."</p>

<p>"Well," said the miller, "we can but try."</p>

<p>So he and his son got down, and tied the legs of the ass
together. Then they slung him on a pole, and carried him on
their shoulders. It was such a funny sight that the people
laughed and jeered at them.</p>

<p>The poor ass was very uncomfortable, and tried hard to
get off the pole. At last, as they were passing over a bridge,
he pulled his legs out of the rope and tumbled to the ground.
He was so frightened that he jumped off the bridge into the
river and was drowned.</p>

<p>Do you know what this story teaches you?</p>

<p><i>If you try to please everybody, you will please nobody</i>.</p>

<h2>THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">J</span></p>
<p><b>ACK</b> and Margaret were growing more excited each day,
because Christmas was so near. They talked of nothing
but Santa Claus.</p>

<p>"Don't you wish you could <i>see</i> him?" they said over and
over.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page508" id="page508"></a>[page&nbsp;508]</span>

<p>One night, just before Christmas, Mother tucked them in
bed and left them to go to sleep. But Jack wiggled, Margaret
wriggled. At last they both sat up in bed.</p>

<p>"Jack," Margaret whispered, "are you asleep?"</p>

<p>"No," said Jack, "I can't go to sleep. Margaret, don't you
wish you could see Santa Claus? What's that?"</p>

<p>They both listened, and they heard a little <i>tap, tap</i> on the
window. They looked, and there, right in the window, they
saw a funny little Brownie.</p>

<p>"What's that I heard you say? You want to see Santa
Claus? Well, I am one of his Brownies. I am on my way
back to Santa Claus Land. I'll take you with me if you want
to go."</p>

<p>Jack and Margaret scrambled from their beds.</p>

<p>"Come on, show us the way!" they cried in great excitement.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," said the Brownie. "No one must know the
way to Santa Claus Land. Kindly wait a moment."</p>

<p>Then the Brownie took something soft and thick and dark,
and tied it around Jack's eyes. Next he took something soft
and thick and dark, and tied it around Margaret's eyes.</p>

<p>"How many fingers before you?" he asked.</p>

<p>Both of them shook their heads. They could not see a
wink.</p>

<p>"Very well, now we're off," said the Brownie.</p>

<p>He took Jack's hand on one side, and Margaret's on the
other. It seemed as if they flew through the window. They
went on swiftly for a little while, then the Brownie whirled
them round and round until they were dizzy, and off they
went again. The children could not tell whether they were
going north, south, east, or west. After a time they stopped.</p>

<p>"Here we are," said the Brownie.</p>

<p>He uncovered their eyes, and the children saw that they
were standing before a big, thick gate.</p>

<p>The Brownie knocked and the gate was swung open. They
went through it, right into Santa Claus's garden.</p>

<p>It was a very queer garden. There were rows and rows
of Christmas trees, all glittering with balls and cobwebby
<span class="left"><a name="page509" id="page509"></a>[page&nbsp;509]</span>
tinsel, and instead of flower beds there were beds of every
kind of toy in the world. Margaret at once ran over to a
bed of dolls.</p>

<p>"Let's see if any of them are ripe," said the Brownie.</p>

<p>"Ripe?" said Margaret in great surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, of course," said the Brownie. "Now if this one
is ripe it will shut its eyes."</p>

<p>The Brownie picked a little doll from the bed and laid it
in Margaret's arms. Its eyes went half shut, and then stuck.</p>

<p>"No, it's not ripe yet," said the Brownie. "Try this one."</p>

<p>He picked another one, and this one shut its eyes just as
if it had gone to sleep.</p>

<p>"We'll take that one," he said, and he dropped it into a
big sack he was carrying.</p>

<p>"Now this one cries, if it's ripe," he said as he picked a
lovely infant doll. The Brownie gave it a squeeze, and the
doll made a funny squeaking noise.</p>

<p>"Not quite ripe," he said, and he put it back into the bed.
He tried several others, and he picked a good many. Some
of them cried, some said "Mamma" and "Papa," and some
danced when they were wound up.</p>

<p>"Oh, do come over here, Margaret!" Jack called.</p>

<p>Margaret ran over to another bed and there were drums&mdash;big
drums, little drums, and middle sized drums; yellow
drums, blue drums, green drums, red drums.</p>

<p>"Can we gather some of these?" said Jack to the Brownie.</p>

<p>"Why, of course. Let's see if this one is ripe."</p>

<p>The Brownie took up a little red drum, and gave it a
thump with a drum stick. But it made such a queer sound
that Jack and Margaret both laughed out loud. The little red
drum was put back into the bed, and the Brownie tried another
big one. It went <i>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom</i>!
and Jack and Margaret marched all along the bed, keeping
step to it.</p>

<p>When they had finished picking drums, they went over to
a bed filled with horns. That was the most fun of all. Some
of them made very queer noises, and on some the Brownie
played jolly little tunes.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page510" id="page510"></a>[page&nbsp;510]</span>

<p>The next bed they came to was filled with toys which
could be wound up. There were trains, automobiles, dancing
dolls, climbing monkeys, hopping birds, funny wobbling ducks,
and every kind of toy you could think of. The children stayed
at this bed for a long time.</p>

<p>At last Margaret said: "But where is Santa Claus? We
wanted to see him."</p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure," said the Brownie. "Come along," and
he led them down a long, winding walk, to the edge of the
garden. Then he pointed to a hill in the distance.</p>

<p>"Do you see that large white house? There is where he
lives."</p>

<p>The children stared at it. It was so white that it seemed
to shine in the distance.</p>

<p>"Walk right across here," said the Brownie, "then up the
hill to Santa Claus's house."</p>

<p>"Oh, must we walk across there?" said Margaret. She
stared down at the deep dark chasm between the garden and
the hill; across it was stretched a narrow plank.</p>

<p>"Walk carefully," said the Brownie, "and mind you don't
look down; for if you do, I'm afraid you won't see Santa
Claus to-night."</p>

<p>"We'll be very careful," said Jack. "Come along, Margaret,"
and he took his little sister's hand and they started
across the plank.</p>

<p>They had almost reached the middle of it when Jack looked
down.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said, and gave Margaret a pull.</p>

<p>She looked down too, and cried "Oh, Oh!" and down,
down, down they went.</p>

<p>Suddenly they landed with a thump. They sat up and
rubbed their eyes. There they were right in their own beds
at home. Mother opened the door.</p>

<p>"Are you awake, children?" she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother, we haven't been asleep. We've been to
Santa Claus Land, and we nearly saw Santa Claus!"</p>

<p>Then they told her all about it, and Mother just smiled.</p>

<h2>THE GREEDY BROWNIE</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">T</span></p>
<p><b>HERE</b> was once a little Brownie who lived in a hollow
tree stump. He had been busy all the day playing pranks.
His pranks had taken him far away from home to the house of
a very important laird. Into the laird's cup of wine he had
dropped some sour berries which he had picked on his way.
He also put thistles into his boots, so that when the laird had
drawn them on he had screamed out with pain.</p>

<p>The Brownie had been away all the day, so that when at
last he turned to go back to his home he felt really very tired.
On his way back to the wood he passed by a cozy-looking
farmhouse. The door of the dairy was open. The Brownie
thought this would be a very nice cool place in which to rest
for a few moments. So he slipped into the dairy, and curled
himself up underneath the bench to have a nice little doze.</p>

<p>He was so weary that once he had fallen asleep he never
woke up again until it was quite dark, when he was disturbed
by two lassies who had come into the dairy.</p>

<p>One was carrying a candle in her hand, and by its light
the pair espied a big bowl of cream on the shelf. The naughty
girls thought that they would drink it for supper. They could
only find one spoon on the shelf, so they decided they would
each have a spoonful in turn. Lassie Jean took the bowl and
carried it to a bench in the corner, and Lassie Meg followed
it with the candle. No sooner had the two girls settled themselves
than the Brownie, who was now wide awake, and who
was himself feeling that some supper might not be out of
place, crept up behind them and blew out the candle.</p>

<p>The lassies at first were very much concerned at being in
the dark; nevertheless they determined they would drink the
cream, all the same.</p>

<p>Lassie Jean filled the spoon with the rich delicacy. She
was about to raise it to her lips when the naughty Brownie
poked his head over her shoulder, and lapped it out of the
spoon before it had reached her mouth. Lassie Meg, believing
that Lassie Jean had already swallowed some cream while she
<span class="left"><a name="page512" id="page512"></a>[page&nbsp;512]</span>
had had none, stretched out her hand to take away the spoon
from her friend. Lassie Jean was not willing to give it up,
since she said she had not yet tasted any cream. Lassie Meg
was unwilling to believe her, for she declared she had heard
her lapping the cream.</p>

<p>Without waiting for Lassie Jean to explain, she snatched
the spoon out of her friend's hand. She filled it with cream
from the bowl, and was about to raise it to her lips when the
Brownie jumped from behind Lassie Jean, and settling himself
behind Lassie Meg's shoulders, poked forward his head, and
again lapped up the cream from out of the spoon.</p>

<p>Lassie Jean in her turn snatched back the spoon from
Lassie Meg. Thus they went on, for every time one or the
other raised the spoonful of cream to her lips it was lapped
up by the Brownie. This continued until the bowl was emptied.
The Brownie was full of cream, but the poor lassies had not
so much as tasted one drop, although each believed the other
had drunk it all.</p>

<p>The lassies were still quarreling when the door of the
dairy was opened, and the farmer's wife entered, carrying a
lighted candle in her hand. The moment that she did so the
Brownie hopped under the bench and the lassies started up
guiltily.</p>

<p>The farmer's wife caught sight of the empty basin. She
was very angry with them indeed. When they tried hastily
to explain, each blaming the other, the farmer's wife would
not listen, but only grew the more angry. She told them that,
since they had supped so well, they should have none of the
scones and eggs which she had prepared for the evening meal
in the kitchen.</p>

<p>When the farmer's wife had entered she had left the door
open, so while she was busily scolding the lassies the Brownie
slipped out from under the bench and made his escape. As
he ran chuckling down the road, he could still hear her angry
voice drowning the attempted explanations of the bewildered
lassies. When the little fellow curled himself up some time
later in the tree trunk he was still laughing.</p>

<p><b>AP</b>, tap, tap, rap! "Get up, gaffer Ferryman,"<br />
"Eh! Who is there?" The clock strikes three.<br />
"Get up, do, gaffer! You are the very man<br />
We have been long, long, longing to see."<br />
The ferryman rises, growling and grumbling,<br />
And goes fum-fumbling, and stumbling, and tumbling<br />
Over the wares on his way to the door.<br />
But he sees no more<br />
Than he saw before;<br />
Till a voice is heard: "O Ferryman dear!<br />
Here we are waiting, all of us, here.<br />
We are a wee, wee colony, we;<br />
Some two hundred in all, or three,<br />
Ferry us over the river Lee,<br />
Ere dawn of day,<br />
And we will pay<br />
The most we may<br />
In our own wee way!"<br /><br />

"Who are you? Whence came you?<br />
What place are you going to?"<br />
"Oh, we have dwelt over-long in this land;<br />
The people get cross, and are growing so knowing, too!<br />
Nothing at all but they now understand.<br />
We are daily vanishing under the thunder<br />
Of some huge engine or iron wonder;<br />
That iron, ah! it has entered our souls."<br />
"Your souls? O gholes,<br />
You queer little drolls,<br />
Do you mean....?" "Good gaffer, do aid us with speed,<br />
For our time, like our stature, is short indeed!<br />
And a very long way we have to go;<br />
Eight or ten thousand miles or so,<br />
Hither and thither, and to and fro,<br />
<span class="left"><a name="page514" id="page514"></a>[page&nbsp;514]</span>
With our pots and pans<br />
And little gold cans;<br />
But our light caravans<br />
Run swifter than man's."<br /><br />

"Well, well, you may come," said the ferryman affably;<br />
"Patrick, turn out, and get ready the barge."<br />
Then again to the little folk; "Tho' you seem laughably<br />
Small, I don't mind, if your coppers be large."<br />
Oh, dear, what a rushing, what pushing, what crushing<br />
(The watermen making vain efforts at hushing<br />
The hubbub the while), there followed these words.<br />
What clapping of boards,<br />
What strapping of cords,<br />
What stowing away of children and wives,<br />
And platters and mugs, and spoons and knives,<br />
Till all had safely got into the boat,<br />
And the ferryman, clad in his tip-top coat,<br />
And his wee little fairies were safely afloat!<br />
Then ding, ding, ding,<br />
And kling, kling, kling,<br />
How the coppers did ring<br />
In the tin pitcherling.<br /><br />

Off, then, went the boat, at first very pleasantly,<br />
Smoothly, and so forth; but after a while<br />
It swayed and it sagged this and that way, and presently<br />
Chest after chest, and pile after pile,<br />
Of the little folks' goods began tossing and rolling,<br />
And pitching like fun, beyond fairy controlling.<br />
O Mab! if the hubbub were great before,<br />
It was now some two or three million times more.<br />
Crash! went the wee crocks and the clocks; and the locks<br />
Of each little wee box were stove in by hard knocks;<br />
And then there were oaths, and prayers, and cries:<br />
"Take care"&mdash;"See there"&mdash;"O, dear, my eyes!"<br />
"I am killed!"&mdash;"I am drowned!"&mdash;with groans and sighs,<br />
Till to land they drew.<br /><br />
<span class="left"><a name="page515" id="page515"></a>[page&nbsp;515]</span>

"Yeo-ho! Pull to<br />
Tiller-rope thro' and thro'!"<br />
And all's right anew.<br />
"Now, jump upon shore, ye queer little oddities.<br />
(Eh, what is this? . . . where are they, at all?<br />
Where are they, and where are their tiny commodities?<br />
Well, as I live" . . .) He looks blank as a wall,<br />
Poor ferryman! Round him and round him he gazes,<br />
But only gets deeplier lost in the mazes<br />
Of utter bewilderment. All, all are gone,<br />
And he stands alone,<br />
Like a statue of stone,<br />
In a doldrum of wonder. He turns to steer,<br />
And a tinkling laugh salutes his ear,<br />
With other odd sounds: "Ha, ha, ha, ha!<br />
Fol lol! zidzizzle! quee quee! bah! bah!<br />
Fizzigig-giggidy! pshee! sha sha!"<br />
"O ye thieves, ye thieves, ye rascally thieves!"<br />
The good man cries. He turns to his pitcher,<br />
And there, alas, to his horror perceives<br />
That the little folk's mode of making him richer<br />
Has been to pay him with withered leaves!</p>

<h2>THE BROWNIES</h2>

<h4>BY JULIANA HORATIA EWING</h4>

<h3>I</h3>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:0.9em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">"</span><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">C</span></p>
<p><b>HILDREN</b> are a burden," said the tailor, as he sat on
his bench stitching away.</p>

<p>"Children are a blessing," said the kind lady in the window.</p>

<p>It was the tailor's mother who spoke. She was a very old
woman and nearly helpless. All day she sat in a large armchair
knitting rugs.</p>

<p>"What have my two lads ever done to help me?" continued
the tailor, sadly. "They do nothing but play. If I send
Tommy on an errand, he loiters. If I ask him to work, he
does it so unwillingly that I would rather do it myself. Since
their mother died I have indeed had a hard time."</p>

<p>At this moment the two boys came in, their arms full of
moss which they dropped on the floor.</p>

<p>"Is there any supper, grandmother?" asked Tommy.</p>

<p>"No, my child, only some bread for breakfast to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh, grandmother, we are so hungry!" and the boy's eyes
filled with tears.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, my poor children?" said the good
woman.</p>

<p>"Tell us a story, please, so that we can forget we are
hungry. Tell us about the brownie that used to live in your
grandfather's house. What was he like?"</p>

<p>"Like a little man, they say."</p>

<p>"What did he do?"</p>

<p>"He came early in the morning before any one in the house
was awake, and lighted the fire and swept the room and set out
the breakfast. He never would be seen and was off before
they could catch him. But they often heard him laughing and
playing about the house."</p>

<p>"Did they give him any wages, grandmother?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear, he did the work for love. They always set
<span class="left"><a name="page518" id="page518"></a>[page&nbsp;518]</span>
a pan of clear water for him, and now and then a bowl of
bread and milk."</p>

<p>"Oh, grandmother, where did he go?"</p>

<p>"The Old Owl in the woods knows; I do not. When I was
young many people used to go to see the Old Owl at moon-rise,
and ask her what they wanted to know."</p>

<p>"How I wish a brownie would come and live with us!"
cried Tommy.</p>

<p>"So do I," said Johnny.</p>

<p>"Will you let us set out a pan of water for the brownie,
father?" asked Tommy.</p>

<p>"You may set out what you like, my lad, but you must go to
bed now."</p>

<p>The boys brought out a pan of water. Then they climbed
the ladder to the loft over the kitchen.</p>

<p>Johnny was soon in the land of dreams, but Tommy lay
awake thinking how he could find a brownie and get him to
live in the house. "There is an owl that lives in the grove,"
he thought. "It may be the Old Owl herself. When the moon
rises, I'll go and find her."</p>


<h3>II</h3>


<p>The moon rose like gold and went up in the heavens like
silver. Tommy opened his eyes and ran to the window. "The
moon has risen," said he, "and it is time for me to go." Downstairs
he crept softly and out into the still night.</p>

<p>"Hoot! hoot!" cried a voice from the grove near the house.</p>

<p>"That's the Old Owl," thought Tommy. He ran to a big
tree and looked up. There he saw the Old Owl, sitting on a
branch and staring at him with yellow eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" said Tommy, for he did not like the Owl very
well.</p>

<p>"Come up here! Come up here!" she cried.</p>

<p>Tommy climbed the tree and sat face to face with her on
the big branch.</p>

<p>"Now, what do you want?" said the Owl.</p>

<p>"Please," said Tommy, "I want to know where to find the
brownies, and how to get one to come and live with us."</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page519" id="page519"></a>[page&nbsp;519]</span>

<p>"Oo-hoo! oo-hoo!" said the Owl. "That's it, is it? I
know of three brownies."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" said Tommy. "Where do they live?"</p>

<p>"In your house," said the Owl.</p>

<p>"In our house! Whereabouts? Why don't they work?"
cried Tommy.</p>

<p>"One of them is too little," said the Owl.</p>

<p>"But why don't the other two do something?" said Tommy.
"Nobody does any work at our house except father."</p>

<p>"They are idle, they are idle," said the Old Owl.</p>

<p>"Then we don't want them," said Tommy. "What is the
use of having brownies in the house if they do nothing to help
us?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps they don't know what to do."</p>

<p>"I wish you would tell me where to find them," said Tommy.
"I could tell them what to do."</p>

<p>"Could you, could you? Oo-hoo! oo-hoo!" and Tommy
could not tell whether the Owl was hooting or laughing.</p>

<p>"Of course I could. They might get up early in the morning
and sweep the house, and light the fire, and spread the
table before my father comes downstairs."</p>

<p>"So they might!" said the Owl. "Well, I can tell you
where to find one of the brownies, and he can tell you where
to find his brother. Go to the north side of the pond, where
the moon is shining on the water, turn yourself around three
times, while you say this charm:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>'<i>Twist me and turn me and show me the elf</i>&mdash;</p>
<p><i>I looked in the water and saw</i>&mdash;'</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Then look in the water, and think of a word which rhymes with
'elf' and makes the charm complete."</p>

<p>Tommy knew the place very well. He ran to the north
side of the pond, and turning himself around three times, he
repeated the charm. Then he looked in and saw&mdash;himself.</p>

<p>"Why, there's no one but myself. I can't think of the
right word. What can it be? I'll go back and ask the Old
Owl," thought Tommy. And back he went. There sat the
Owl as before.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page520" id="page520"></a>[page&nbsp;520]</span>

<p>"Oo-hoo," said she, as Tommy climbed up. "Did you find
out the word?"</p>

<p>"No," said Tommy, "I could find no word that rhymes with
'elf' except 'myself.'"</p>

<p>"Well, that is the word! Now, do you know where your
brother is?"</p>

<p>"In bed in the loft," said Tommy.</p>

<p>"Then all your questions are answered. Good night;" and
the Old Owl began to shake her feathers.</p>

<p>"Don't go yet," said Tommy, humbly; "I don't understand
you. I am not a brownie, am I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you are, and a very idle one, too," said the Old
Owl. "All children are brownies."</p>

<p>"But are there really any brownies except children?" inquired
Tommy, in a dismal tone.</p>

<p>"No, there are not. Now listen to me, Tommy. Little
people can do only little things. When they are idle and mischievous,
they are called boggarts, and they are a burden to
the house they live in. When they are thoughtful and useful,
they are brownies, and are a blessing to every one."</p>

<p>"I'll be a brownie," said Tommy. "I won't be a boggart.
Now I'll go home and tell Johnny."</p>

<p>"I'll take you home," said the Owl, and in a moment Tommy
found himself in bed, with Johnny sleeping by his side.</p>

<p>"How quickly we came," said Tommy to himself. "But is
it morning? That is very strange! I thought the moon was
shining. Come, Johnny, get up, I have a story to tell you."</p>


<h3>III</h3>


<p>While his brother was rubbing his eyes Tommy told him
of his visit to the Old Owl in the grove.</p>

<p>"Is that all true?" asked Johnny.</p>

<p>"It is all just as I tell you, and if we don't want to be boggarts,
we must get up and go to work."</p>

<p>"I won't be a boggart," said Johnny, and so the two
brownies crept softly down the ladder into the kitchen. "I
<span class="left"><a name="page521" id="page521"></a>[page&nbsp;521]</span>
will light the fire," said Tommy. "And you, Johnny, can dig
some potatoes to roast for breakfast." They swept the room
and laid the table. Just as they were putting the potatoes in a
dish they heard footsteps.</p>

<p>"There's father," said Tommy; "we must run."</p>

<p>The poor tailor came wearily down the stairs. Morning
after morning he had found an untidy room and an empty
table. But now when he entered the kitchen, he looked around
in great surprise. He put his hand out to the fire to see if it
was really warm. He touched the potatoes and looked at the
neat room. Then he shouted, "Mother, mother! boys, boys, the
brownie has come!"</p>

<p>There was great excitement in the small house, but the
boys said nothing. All day the tailor talked about the brownie.
"I have often heard of Little People," he said, "but this is
wonderful. To come and do the work for a pan of cold water!
Who would have believed it?"</p>

<p>The boys said nothing until they were both in bed. Then
Tommy said: "The Old Owl was right, and we must stick to
the work if we don't want to be boggarts. But I don't like to
have father thinking that we are still idle. I wish he knew that
we are the brownies."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Johnny.</p>

<p>Day after day went by and still the boys rose early, and
each day they found more and more to do. The brownies were
the joy of the tailor's life.</p>

<p>One day a message came for the tailor to go to a farmhouse
several miles away. The farmer gave him an order for
a suit of clothes, and paid him at once. Full of joy at his good
fortune, he hurried home. As he came near the house, he saw
that the garden had been weeded. "It's that brownie!" he
said; "and I shall make a suit of clothes for him."</p>

<p>"If you make clothes for the brownie, he will leave the
house," said the grandmother.</p>

<p>"Not if the clothes are a good fit, mother. I shall measure
them by Tommy, for they say the brownies are about his size."</p>

<p>At last a fine new suit with brass buttons was finished and
laid out for the brownie.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page522" id="page522"></a>[page&nbsp;522]</span>

<p>"Don't the clothes look fine?" said Tommy, when he came
down in the morning; "I'll try them on."</p>

<p>The tailor rose earlier than usual that day, for he wished to
catch a glimpse of the brownies. He went softly downstairs.
There was Johnny sweeping the floor, and Tommy trying on
the new suit.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" shouted the father.</p>

<p>"It's the brownies," said the boys.</p>

<p>"This is no joke," cried the tailor, angrily. "Where are the
real brownies, I say?"</p>

<p>"We are the only brownies, father," said Tommy.</p>

<p>"I can't understand this. Who has been sweeping the
kitchen lately, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"We have," said the boys.</p>

<p>"Who gets breakfast and puts things in order?"</p>

<p>"We do! we do!" they shouted.</p>

<p>"But when do you do it?"</p>

<p>"Early in the morning before you come down."</p>

<p>"But if you do the work, where is the brownie?"</p>

<p>"Here," cried the boys; "we are the brownies, and we are
sorry that we were boggarts so long."</p>

<p>The father was delighted to find how helpful his boys had
become. The grandmother, however, could hardly believe
that a real brownie had not been in the house. But as she sat
in her chair day after day watching the boys at their work,
she often repeated her favorite saying, "Children are a
blessing."</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF PETER PAN</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> upon a time there were three children named Wendy,
John, and Michael, who lived with their father and mother
in London. One evening the father and mother were invited
to a party, and the mother, after lighting the dim lamp in the
nursery and kissing them good-night, went away. That evening
a little boy climbed in through the window, whose name
<span class="left"><a name="page523" id="page523"></a>[page&nbsp;523]</span>
was Peter Pan. He was a curious little fellow, very conceited,
very forgetful, and yet very lovable. The most remarkable
thing about him was that he never grew up. There came
flitting in through the window with him his fairy, whose name
was Tinker Bell. Peter Pan woke all the children up, and
after he had sprinkled fairy dust on their shoulders, he took
them away to the Neverland, where he lived with a family of
lost boys. Tinker Bell was jealous of the little girl Wendy,
and she hurried ahead of Peter Pan and persuaded the boys
that Wendy was a bird who might do them harm, and so one
of the boys shot her with his bow and arrow.</p>

<p>When Peter Pan came and found Wendy lying lifeless
upon the ground in the woods he was very angry, but he was
also very quick-witted. So he told the boys that if they would
build a house around Wendy he was sure that she would be
better. So they hurried to collect everything they had out of
which they could make a house. Though she was not yet
strong enough to talk, they thought perhaps she might sing
the kind of house she would like to have, so Wendy sang
softly this little verse:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"I wish I had a pretty house,</p>
<p class="i2">The littlest ever seen,</p>
<p>With funny little red walls</p>
<p class="i2">And roof of mossy green."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>When the house was done Peter Pan took John's hat for
the chimney, and the little house was so pleased to have such
a capital chimney that smoke at once began to come out
through the hat. All that night Peter Pan walked up and
down in front of Wendy's house, to watch over her and keep
her from danger while she slept.</p>

<p>All these children lived in an underground cave, and the
next day, when Wendy got well, they all went down into the
cave and Wendy agreed to be their mother and Peter their
father. They had many good times together. They also had
some exciting adventures with the red-skins and with a pirate
named Captain Hook and his crew. After a time the redskins
became their friends, and Peter rescued his family from
the pirates' ship.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page524" id="page524"></a>[page&nbsp;524]</span>

<p>One day Wendy and her brothers realized that they had
been away so long that perhaps their mother had forgotten
them and shut the window of the nursery so that they could
not get back. They decided to hurry home. When they
reached home Peter Pan was before them, and he closed the
window so that they could not get back. But when he heard
the children's mother singing such a sad song inside, his heart
was made tender and he opened the window and the children
crept back safely into their mother's arms. Wendy's mother
invited Peter Pan to stay and be her child, but Peter was so
afraid that he would have to go to school and grow up and be
a man that he went back to his home in fairy-land.</p>

<p>Wendy promised to go once a year and stay a few days
with Peter Pan and clean house and mend his clothes. Let
us picture them in the little house that was built for Wendy,
which the fairies had put up in the branches of a pine-tree.
The birds are singing in their nests and in the branches, and
far below the clouds you can see the land and the sea. Wendy
is sewing for Peter and Peter Pan is playing his pipes while
she works. When night comes the woods are full of flashing
lights like little stars, because the fairies are flitting around
the house where Peter and Wendy live, and are singing to
them as they go to sleep.</p>

<p>In a few days Wendy will go back to John and Michael
to tell them what a good time she had on her visit in the little
house in the woods.</p>

<h2>SIR LARK AND KING SUN</h2>

<p><b>OOD</b> morrow, my lord!" in the sky alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the lark as the sun ascended his throne.<br />
"Shine on me, my lord; I only am come,<br />
Of all your servants, to welcome you home.<br />
I have flown right up, a whole hour, I swear,<br />
To catch the first shine of your golden hair."<br /><br />

"Must I thank you then," said the king, "Sir Lark,<br />
For flying so high and hating the dark?<br />
You ask a full cup for half a thirst:<br />
Half was love of me, and half love to be first.<br />
There's many a bird makes no such haste,<br />
But waits till I come; that's as much to my taste."<br /><br />

And King Sun hid his head in a turban of cloud,<br />
And Sir Lark stopped singing, quite vexed and cowed;<br />
But he flew up higher, and thought, "Anon<br />
The wrath of the king will be over and gone;<br />
And his crown, shining out of its cloudy fold,<br />
Will change my brown feathers to a glory of gold."<br /><br />

So he flew&mdash;with the strength of a lark he flew;<br />
But, as he rose, the cloud rose too;<br />
And not one gleam of the golden hair<br />
Came through the depths of the misty air;<br />
Till, weary with flying, with sighing sore,<br />
The strong sun-seeker could do no more.<br /><br />

His wings had had no chrism of gold;<br />
And his feathers felt withered and worn and old;<br />
He faltered, and sank, and dropped like a stone.<br />
And there on his nest, where he left her, alone<br />
Sat his little wife on her little eggs,<br />
Keeping them warm with wings and legs.<br /><br />
<span class="left"><a name="page526" id="page526"></a>[page&nbsp;526]</span>

Did I say alone? Ah, no such thing!<br />
Full in her face was shining the king.<br />
"Welcome, Sir Lark! You look tired," said he;<br />
"<i>Up</i> is not always the best way to me.<br />
While you have been singing so high and away,<br />
I've been shining to your little wife all day."<br /><br />

He had set his crown all about the nest,<br />
And out of the midst shone her little brown breast;<br />
And so glorious was she in russet gold,<br />
That for wonder and awe Sir Lark grew cold.<br />
He popped his head under her wing, and lay<br />
As still as a stone, till King Sun was away.</p>

<h2>THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW</h2>

<h4>BY KATE E. BUNCE (after RUDOLF BAUNBACH)</h4>

<p><b>O</b> Heaven's Meadows, bright with flowers and sunshine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little children go,<br />
When they have had enough of life's sad dreaming,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave the earth below.<br /><br />

But as they had not time to learn their lessons<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before they went away,<br />
There is a school, where all the angel children<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must work four hours a day.<br /><br />

With golden pencils upon silver tablets,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They copy fairy tales,<br />
And learn to keep their halos bright and shining,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sing, and play their scales.<br /><br />

And twice a week they glide with merry laughter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All down the Milky Way,<br />
And homeward in the evening wander softly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a sunset ray.<br /><br />
<span class="left"><a name="page527" id="page527"></a>[page&nbsp;527]</span>

But Sunday is the day they love and long for,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all the children go<br />
And play from morn till night within a meadow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where flowers in thousands grow.<br /><br />

The meadow is not green, but blue and golden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowers like dewdrops bright;<br />
When it is night, they burn and glow and glisten&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men call them stars of light.<br /><br />

Through Heaven's gate they all must pass to find it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Peter with the key<br />
Keeps watch and warns the little angels kindly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How good they all must be.<br /><br />

They must not fly about or run too quickly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor go too far away,<br />
And when upon his golden key he calls them,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they must all obey.<br /><br />

One day it was so very hot in Heaven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That good St. Peter slept,<br />
And when the little angel children saw it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away they quickly crept.<br /><br />

Ah! then they ran and flew about with laughter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fluttered far and wide,<br />
So far they wandered that of Heaven's meadow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They reached the other side.<br /><br />

They came to where the strong, tall, wooden paling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuts all that place away,<br />
Where idle, careless, mischief-loving, naughty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imps of Darkness stray.<br /><br />

And there the angels stopped, devoutly wishing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some opening there might be,<br />
So that they might each one in turn peep through it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And see what they could see.<br /><br />
<span class="left"><a name="page528" id="page528"></a>[page&nbsp;528]</span>

But not a chink or hole, for all their seeking,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No gleam of light pierced through,<br />
So with their little wings outspread and eager,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right to the top they flew.<br /><br />

And looking down they saw with awe and wonder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imps all as black as soot;<br />
Each had two horns and each a tail to play with,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hoof, instead of foot.<br /><br />

They heard the rustle of the angel feathers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They felt the cool sweet air,<br />
And, lifting up their little coal-black faces,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw Heaven's children there.<br /><br />

Then with one voice they cried: "Oh! angel Children,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You look so good and fair,<br />
We pray you, let us come up into Heaven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And play a little there.<br /><br />

"We will not tweak nor pull your shining feathers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But be so very good;<br />
We will not try and steal your little halos,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all do as we should."<br /><br />

Then quick they flew away for Jacob's ladder,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Peter was still asleep),<br />
And placed it safely, where from Heaven to Imp-land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way was dark and steep.<br /><br />

Then every little imp, with shouts and laughter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helped by an angel's hand,<br />
Scrambled right over the great wooden paling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stood in Heaven's land.<br /><br />

They all, with air sedate and pious faces,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discreetly walked around,<br />
Their tails like trains upon their arms upholding,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eyes upon the ground.<br /><br />
<span class="left"><a name="page529" id="page529"></a>[page&nbsp;529]</span>

The little angels fluttered round in rapture,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And showed the lovely flowers,<br />
And bade them listen to the thrilling voices<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of birds in Heaven's bowers.<br /><br />

And gently led them by the crystal streamlets,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bade them on dewdrops feast,<br />
And showed them where the silver moon was rising<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To light them from the east.<br /><br />

Alas! when all the little demons saw her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon, so large and round,<br />
They all began to roar, and growl, and gibber,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leap from off the ground;<br /><br />

And mocked the great white moon with ugly faces,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned somersaults in air,<br />
And when the angels prayed them cease, in terror,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They vowed they did not care.<br /><br />

They trampled down the grass in Heaven's Meadow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They tore the flowers about,<br />
And flung them on the earth beyond the paling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With gibe, and jeer, and shout.<br /><br />

They chased the birds that sang among the tree-tops<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hushed their music sweet,<br />
They pulled the little angels' tender feathers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And trod upon their feet.<br /><br />

Then to the good St. Peter cried the angels<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help them in their pain,<br />
And if he would but this one time forgive them,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would be good again.<br /><br />

Then rose St. Peter from his peaceful dreaming&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An angry saint was he&mdash;<br />
He wrung his hands and clasped his head in horror,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seized his golden key.<br /><br />
<span class="left"><a name="page530" id="page530"></a>[page&nbsp;530]</span>

Then blew a mighty blast in wrath upon it;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back all the angels flew,<br />
And wide he threw the door of heaven open,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thrust the children through.<br /><br />

And then he called two great and powerful angels,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strongest of the race,<br />
To chase the little demons out of Heaven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clear the holy place.<br /><br />

They gathered up the little imps in armfuls,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bore them with mighty stride,<br />
And flung them over the strong wooden paling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down on the other side.<br /><br />

And though they fought and lashed their tails and whimpered,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kicked with might and main,<br />
To Heaven's Meadow, bright with sun and flowers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They never came again.<br /><br />

For two long months the little angel-children<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were not allowed to play<br />
Before the door of Heaven in the meadow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But stayed in all the day.<br /><br />

And when again they sought the Heavenly Meadow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each child with humble mind<br />
Must lay aside its little shining halo,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave its wings behind.<br /><br />

But all the flowers that on that day of sorrow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flung out and scattered were,<br />
Took root and bloom again in earth's green meadows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As daisies white and fair.</p>

<h2>THE BIRTHDAY HONORS OF THE FAIRY QUEEN&nbsp;<a name="br" id="br"></a><a href="#b"><sup>*</sup></a></h2>

<h4>BY HAPGOOD MOORE</h4>

<p style="line-height: 1%; margin-top: -0.5em;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="float:left; font-size:2.3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:85%;">O</span></p>
<p><b>NCE</b> upon a time there lived in green Erin a little girl by
the name of Nora. Her home was a small thatched cottage
of stone beside the brae at the foot of a mountain, in the
midst of a woodland so deep that in the summer time when
the trees were full the sun got its rays inside but a few hours
of the day and you could see of the star-dust that covers the
fields of the sky no piece larger than the palm of your hand.</p>

<p>It was a famous meeting-place for the fairies, this haunt at
the foot of the mountain by the stream, for the Little Folk
from the heather above used nightly to foregather in the
meadow with the Little Folk from the woodland below, and
there they danced the long night through among the shamrocks.
But although Nora had heard about the fairies from
her grandmother, who sat all day tending the peat fire, and
something more about them from her mother when of an
evening after supper she had time to speak to Nora of herself
when she was a girl, yet Nora had never in all her life
set eyes upon one of these feasters of the forest. For the
fairies, mind you, come only to two kinds of folk, to those who
believe in them and to those who need them. Now Nora believed
in the fairies all right, all right, but she had never been
in need of them until now, at this time that I'm telling ye of.</p>

<p>Now this same Nora was one of these lasses that is a wee
bit gloomery. And ye don't know what this same gloomery
is? Well, she was at times hindered by a rainy mornin' disposition.
So it was plain enough to the fairies that she was
in some need of them.</p>

<p>One day Nora went into the deep of the wildwood a few
steps below her mother's cottage to a trysting-place where she
often resorted when she had the time from her daily duties.</p>
<span class="left"><a name="page532" id="page532"></a>[page&nbsp;532]</span>

<p>She had been unusually heckled that morning, as all of us are
at times, by being obliged to do many things for the which she
had little liking. The spot was a favorite one of Nora's.</p>

<p>There was a shelter of rocks above, almost like a cave or
roof, and below there was a tiny stream of water that ran out
of a spring in the back of the hill and sang its way down the
slope to the brae below. In this pool Nora nearly always laid
some field flowers, because they kept fresher there than anywhere
else. From the low seat that Nora had made out of a
stone in the back of her shelter she looked out into a sunny
place in the woods, around which stood, as if they were pillars
of a woodland palace, six gray beeches.</p>

<p>Now upon this sunny afternoon that I am speaking of,
hardly had Nora reclined upon her bench, feeling a bit drowsy
no doubt with the heat, yet not quite sleepy you know, listening
to a robin singing with the voice of Eden, when she heard a
light tapping on the wall of the largest beech, the one that was
nearest to the place where she was lying. At first when she
heard this sound she thought that it was the robin redbreast
that she had noticed hopping up and down in the open place in
the sunlight, and yet she knew well that robins do not drum
upon the bark of trees like woodpeckers. So she jumped
lightly up and ran to the tree, and at once she was aware that
the tapping was from inside the tree. And between the taps
that were no louder than those of a branch against a window-pane
she distinctly heard a very tiny voice.</p>

<p>"How tiny was the voice, Michael aroon?"</p>

<p>You are asking me how tiny was the voice? Let me see
if I can tell you. You have heard the sound of the rivulet
when it falls upon the mossy stones in the pasture by the bar-way?
Well, it was about as loud as the echo of that if you
should walk thirty paces away and then listen. So Nora had
to put her ear up close against the breast of the beech-tree and
even then the voice sounded no louder than the sound of a
beech-leaf when it falls from a branch into the moss-bed. But
she could hear what that voice was saying, and it was these
words: "Nora, my darling, turn the key and let me out." Nora
looked around in amazement, but sure enough, there on the
<span class="left"><a name="page533" id="page533"></a>[page&nbsp;533]</span>
breast of the beech, about the height of her heart, was a small
key of the color of the bark, that she had never noticed before,
though she had hugged that beech-tree every morning of her
life. So Nora turned the key at once, and out stepped&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A fairy, Michael?"</p>

<p>Yes, better than a fairy, a dryad, that is a fairy of the tree.
For a fairy of a tree is as much higher in rank than a fairy
of the meadow as a duchess is than a goose-girl. She was
about the size of the robin redbreast, and she was dressed all
in green, except a lovely cloak of red that, when it was folded
about her, made her look very much indeed like the redbreast
himself, and she was no bit bigger than the robin either.</p>

<p>"Nora Mavourneen," said the dryad, "I have been noticing
that you seem a bit sad-hearted of late, and for no reason
either that anybody knows, so if you don't mind I will take
you with me for a walk this afternoon through fairyland, and
we will see if we cannot do something to restore your good
spirits again."</p>

<p>At these words Nora danced for joy, and you would never
have been able to guess that she had ever known a downhearted
moment. So the dryad clapped her tiny hands three times, and
out of the open door into the beech-tree stepped a little gnome
who came and bowed low before them, holding in his hands a
silver salver on which lay a little pellet.</p>

<p>"How little was the pellet, uncle?"</p>

<p>"Well, what would you say if I told you that it was as small
as a humming bird's egg? Oh, you think it was smaller than
that? Well, how about the seed of a coriander? No? Then
I will tell you the truth. It was as small as the gnat that gets
into your eye, that feels as big as a rat."</p>

<p>So Nora took the pellet from the platter and thanked the
gnome kindly and she ate it down, and no sooner had she
swallowed it than she was no bigger than the dryad herself.</p>

<p>So the dryad took her by the hand and they walked gaily
into the beech-tree door, and the door shut behind them.</p>

<p>They went down and down a lot of winding stairs that were
lighted only by small windows in the bark of the tree that Nora
had never noticed before and could never find afterward. It
<span class="left"><a name="page534" id="page534"></a>[page&nbsp;534]</span>
was very cool and pleasant, for they could hear the sap go
singing on its way from the roots up to the branches and leaves
and when a summer shower went by they could hear the raindrops
as they went singing down the trunk outside to the roots.
After they had reached the foot of the stairs they walked for
a long way through a cool corridor. It was not quite dark,
for Little People stood at every turn who seemed to be doing
what fireflies do on summer nights in the grass, and each one
whistling to himself as he held his softly shaded lantern aloft.
Down the side passages Nora could see thousands of tiny
miners at work. And what do you think they are doing?</p>

<p>"Digging for gold and diamonds."</p>

<p>They were tending the woodland plants that hang their
golden blossoms in the pathways and carrying up the dewdrops
that sparkle like diamonds from their leaves in the daybreak.
And it was pleasant to see them work, for they were all
singing.</p>

<p>By and by Nora and the dryad came to a place where there
was a brighter light ahead, and as they drew nearer Nora could
see that they had come to the bank of the pond that is below
Nora's cottage, only that they were under the surface, looking
up through a light so soft that it cast no shadows. And
now the dryad took Nora's hand and she found herself in a
little boat, no bigger than a leaf, sailing across the pond but
still beneath its surface. And here she saw on every hand,
working amid the mire and the mirk, such jolly little divers,
who were feeding the fish and tending the pond lily roots, and,
like all the others, singing at their tasks.</p>

<p>Now you will know of course that they were on their
way to the home of the fairy queen. And it was but a short
while before they were there. I need not tell you, children,
how lovely is her palace, with its golden floor and silver walls
and its hangings of the colors of the rainbow. Nor need I say
how beautiful is her majesty herself, with wings like the most
splendid butterfly and a gown like the morning and a face
like the sunshine.</p>

<p>It seems that Nora had come upon the queen's birthday,
and she was just giving the birthday honors. So Nora and
<span class="left"><a name="page535" id="page535"></a>[page&nbsp;535]</span>
the dryad stood in the background and watched the scene.
Around the throne stood gallant fairy gentlemen clad like
beetles and dragon flies for splendor and ladies whose long
gowns hung like the light on the waterfall of Loughmareen.
But to the amazement of Nora, those who came forward to
receive the honors were for the most part dressed like workmen
and many of them were bent with hard labor. As each advanced
and made obeisance, the royal herald read the exploit
for which the rank of knighthood was about to be conferred.
For one he read: "To our faithful servant who
covered the lilies of Moira from the attack of the Frost King";
and to another: "To the gallant yeoman who watered the
grain field of Kilvellin"; and to still another: "To him who
dug the trench by the roadside and kept safe the highway to
Throselwait Fair." And as each came forward the trumpets
pealed in triumph, and after a gold star had been pinned upon
the new knight's breast the gentlemen and ladies of the court
greeted them with hearty reverence. And Nora looked in the
smiling face of the dryad, but said nothing.</p>

<p>Then Nora herself, in a breathless moment of fear, was
presented to the queen, and the queen kissed her daintily just
above her lips on both sides. And suddenly Nora found herself
back on her stony bench by the spring with the branches
of the beech-tree waving silently before her.</p>

<p>"Oh, mothereen and grandmotherkin," she cried as soon
as she got home, and she ran home all the way&mdash;"let me tell
you about the wonderful visit I have been making out in the
wildwood." And after she had told her story, mothereen said,
"I think Nora has been dreaming," but grandmotherkin said,
"No, daughter, I think our little acushla has had her eyes
opened the day." Then Nora in triumph showed the two
dimples where the fairy queen had kissed her. And do you
know, my darlings, I cannot but think that she told the truth
after all, for ever after, if one kissed Nora upon those two
dimples or even touched them or even looked at them, she
would break into the sweetest smile, and she never was
gloomerin' or lowerin' any more.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
